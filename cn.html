      <h1>Welcome to the World of Networking</h1>

      <p>Hi, my name is Yash Raj Bhatt. I teach computer networking at Takshila Learning Hubb. I want you to know that behind everything that you read, everything that you watch, everything that you do — is really just an amazing effort of mine. I am dedicated and passionate about helping you learn about networking.</p>

      <p>So you are about to undertake an exciting journey into this world of networking. For me, it's like the one common language that truly unifies us all. Whether you're communicating with a friend next door, or somebody that you've never met halfway across the world — networking is really that one language.</p>

      <p>Those networking protocols that you're going to be learning about are the one language that is used throughout the world — no matter who you're communicating with or where you're communicating from.</p>

      <p>Networking is also, to me, like a jigsaw puzzle. Learning networking is all these different protocols and processes. At first they might not make sense, but the more you learn, you'll see how these protocols and processes fit together. And this whole picture of the internet and networking will become clearer.</p>

      <p>So I want you to know that you're not alone in this journey — I am all behind you. I am truly passionate and dedicated in wanting to help you learn about networking. We hope you enjoy your journey into this world of networking. I'll see you soon.</p>

      <p style="margin-top:6px; font-weight:600;">— Yash Raj Bhatt</p>

  <!-- Everything is Online -->
  <section class="card">
    <div class="stack">
      <h1>Everything is Online</h1>

      <p>“Hey Shad, are you online?” “Of course, I am!” We expect our devices — phones, tablets, laptops, and desktops — to always be connected to the global internet. We use this network to interact with friends, shop, share pictures, and learn. The internet has become such a part of everyday life that we almost take it for granted.</p>

      <p>Normally, when people use the term internet, they think of it as a formless collection of connections — a “place” people go to find or share information. The internet is a worldwide collection of interconnected networks cooperating to exchange information using common standards.</p>

      <h2>Who Owns “The Internet”?</h2>
      <p>The internet is not owned by any individual or group. It is a network of networks. Everything you access online is hosted somewhere on that global fabric — social media, games, email, online courses — each connected to local networks that send and receive information.</p>

      <p>Think about interactions you have daily that require you to be online. Examples:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Intelligent networks deliver news and email to handheld devices.</li>
        <li>Video conferencing connects people around the globe instantly.</li>
        <li>Phones share voice, text, and images globally.</li>
        <li>Online gaming connects thousands of players seamlessly.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Local Networks</h2>
      <p>Local networks range from two computers to hundreds of thousands of devices. SOHO (Small Office/Home Office) networks let you share printers, documents, and media between a few local users. Larger networks provide business services such as advertising, ordering supplies, and customer communications.</p>

      <h2>Small Home Networks</h2>
      <p>Small home networks connect a few computers to each other and to the internet.</p>

      <h2>Medium to Large Networks & World Wide Networks</h2>
      <p>Medium to large networks can span many locations with thousands of hosts. The internet as a whole connects hundreds of millions of computers worldwide — a true network of networks.</p>

  <!-- Data & Bandwidth -->
  <section class="card">
    <h2 class="center">Understanding Data & Its Types</h2>
    <p>Data is the information you input, transmit, or store. Types include volunteer data (you knowingly share it), inferred data (generated from your actions), and observed data (collected automatically, e.g., location).</p>

    <h2>Bandwidth</h2>
    <div class="callout">
      <p><strong>Bandwidth</strong> is the maximum amount of data that can be transmitted over a channel in a given time (measured in bps, Kbps, Mbps, Gbps).</p>
      <p>Bandwidth is the capacity (speed limit); throughput is the actual data rate achieved. Many factors (latency, packet loss, congestion) reduce throughput.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Throughput</h2>
    <p>Throughput is the actual amount of data successfully transmitted over time. Example: a 100 Mbps link may only deliver 70 Mbps throughput due to overhead or congestion.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Causes of reduced throughput: congestion, latency, packet loss, protocol overhead, hardware limits.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- Clients & Servers -->
  <section class="card">
    <h1 class="center">Clients & Servers in Modern Networks</h1>

    <p>Hosts can act as clients, servers, or both. Server software provides services (web, email). Client software (browsers, mail clients) requests and displays those services.</p>

    <h2>Client and Server Roles & Peer-to-Peer Networks</h2>
    <p>Hosts that run both client and server software form peer-to-peer networks (P2P). P2P is easy to set up and low cost but less secure and not as scalable as dedicated-server models.</p>

    <div class="grid cols-2">
      <div>
        <h3>Advantages of P2P</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Easy to set up</li>
          <li>Less complex</li>
          <li>Lower cost</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Disadvantages of P2P</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>No centralized administration</li>
          <li>Not as secure</li>
          <li>Not scalable</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Instant messaging where both clients can send and receive simultaneously.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Network Infrastructure -->
  <section class="card">
    <h1>Network Infrastructure</h1>
    <p>The path a message takes may be a single cable or a global network. The infrastructure includes end devices, intermediate devices, and network media.</p>

    <h3>End devices</h3>
    <ul>

    </ul>

    <p>An end device (host) is the source or destination of messages. Addresses uniquely identify hosts on the network.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- ISP Services -->
  <section class="card">
    <h1>ISP Services</h1>
    <p>An Internet Service Provider (ISP) connects your home network to the wider internet. ISPs may also offer email, storage, hosting, backups and security services.</p>

    <h2>ISP Connections</h2>
    <p>The internet backbone is a web of fiber-optic cables and high-speed equipment. Home connections (cable, DSL, cellular, satellite) link users to this backbone.</p>

    <h2>Cable & DSL</h2>
    <p><strong>Cable:</strong> Internet carried on coaxial cable (same as cable TV). Requires a cable modem.</p>
    <p><strong>DSL:</strong> Runs over phone lines and uses a DSL modem. DSL has separate channels for voice, download and upload.</p>

    <h2>Other Options</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Cellular:</strong> Uses mobile network; convenient for mobility and areas without wired connectivity.</li>
      <li><strong>Satellite:</strong> Useful where wired options are unavailable; requires a clear line of sight.</li>
