    <!-- Intro card -->
    <div style="    padding:16px; margin:16px 0;">
      <p style="color:black; margin:0 0 12px 0;">
        Now, whether we realize it or not, software development is an essential part of our everyday lives.
      </p>
      <p style="color:black; margin:0 0 12px 0;">
        Software in your car, software in your phone, or software in your fridge: It's everywhere, and it's only going to become more ubiquitous as time goes on.
      </p>
      <p style="color:black; margin:0 0 12px 0;">
        But with this increase in demand for software, comes an increase in demand for software developers.
      </p>
      <p style="color:black; margin:0;">
        A software developer is someone who designs, creates, tests and maintains the software that we use every day. And while the demand for software developers is high, there are still a lot of misconceptions about what it takes to become one.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Myth 1 -->
    <h2  style="color:#1f6feb; margin-top:0;   ">Myth #1: You need to be a genius.</h2>
    <div style="  padding:16px; margin:8px 0 16px;">
      <p style="color:black; margin:0 0 12px 0;">
        One of the biggest misconceptions is that you need to be some sort of genius to become a software developer. The stereotype is perpetuated by movies and TV shows that depict software developers as brilliant but socially awkward geniuses.
      </p>
      <p style="color:black; margin:0 0 12px 0;">
        While it certainly helps to be smart, there are plenty of software developers who aren't geniuses. Most of us are just normal people who are good at problem solving and have a knack for computers.
      </p>
      <p style="color:black; margin:0 0 12px 0;">
        So no, you don't need to excel in every academic subject to be successful. What's more important than your grade point average is your willingness to learn new things and your ability to think outside the box.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Myth 2 -->
    <h2  style="color:#1f6feb; margin-top:0; ">Myth #2: You need to major in Computer Science.</h2>
    <div style="  padding:16px; margin:8px 0 16px;">
      <p style="color:black; margin:0 0 12px 0;">
        While a Computer Science degree can certainly help, there are plenty of software developers who don't have one.
      </p>
      <p style="color:black; margin:0 0 12px 0;">
        According to a 2021 developer survey by StackOverflow, questioning over 80,000 developers, around a quarter of respondents have less than a bachelor's degree in any field.
      </p>
      <p style="color:black; margin:0 0 12px 0;">
        Learning the skills required to be a software developer can be done in many ways. There are plenty of coding bootcamps and online courses, but if you want to get a Computer Science degree, I've got some good news.
      </p>
      <p style="color:black; margin:0 0 12px 0;">
        You don't need to spend 4 years and a ton of money getting one. In fact, there are now plenty of schools that offer accelerated, 100% online Computer Science degrees that won't cost you an arm and a leg, and can be completed in as little as two years.
      </p>
      
    </div>

    <!-- Myth 3 -->
    <h2  style="color:#1f6feb; margin-top:0; ">Myth #3: It's too late to start.</h2>
    <div style="   padding:16px; margin:8px 0 16px;">
      <p style="color:black; margin:0 0 12px 0;">
        A lot of people think that software development is a field for young people. And while it's true that many software developers start their careers in their twenties, it's never too late to start.
      </p>
      <p style="color:black; margin:0 0 12px 0;">
        There are many software developers who have started their careers later in life, and there is no reason you can't be one of them. Software development is a field that values experience and creativity over age.
      </p>
      <p style="color:black; margin:0 0 12px 0;">
        Whatever you've done for work up until this point has built skills that transfer: communication, staying calm under pressure, and analytical thinking—all useful as a developer.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Myth 4 -->
    <h2   style="color:#1f6feb; margin-top:0;    ">Myth #4: You need to be a math genius.</h2>
    <div style="  padding:16px; margin:8px 0 16px;">
      <p style="color:black; margin:0 0 12px 0;">
        A good programmer needs strong problem-solving skills, logic and a lot of patience. However, serious math skills are rarely required.
      </p>
      <p style="color:black; margin:0 0 12px 0;">
        Know core algorithms and data structures; beyond that, basic algebra usually suffices unless you work on specialized domains requiring advanced math (unlikely in your first few years).
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Myth 5 -->
    <h2  style="color:#1f6feb; margin-top:0; ">Myth #5: You need to be a Jack/Jill of all trades.</h2>
    <div style="   padding:16px; margin:8px 0 16px;">
      <p style="color:black; margin:0 0 12px 0;">
        Trying to become a master of everything is a fast path to being average at most things. It's better to be really good at a few areas.
      </p>
      <p style="color:black; margin:0 0 12px 0;">
        Focus on skills relevant to your target role. If you’re starting out, pick a language aligned with your field:
      </p>
      <ul style="color:black; margin:0 0 12px 20px;">
        <li style="color:black;">Web: JavaScript</li>
        <li style="color:black;">Mobile: Swift, Kotlin, or Java</li>
        <li style="color:black;">Unsure: any modern language to build foundations</li>
      </ul>
      <p style="color:black; margin:0;">
        Once you have a strong base, learning new languages and tools becomes much easier.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Myth 6 -->
    <h2  style="color:#1f6feb; margin-top:0; ">Myth #6: You are done learning.</h2>
    <div style="   padding:16px; margin:8px 0 16px;">
      <p style="color:black; margin:0 0 12px 0;">
        Tech evolves fast. New languages, frameworks, SDKs, and platforms appear; others fade. Staying current is part of the job.
      </p>
      
    </div>

    <!-- Myth 7 -->
    <h2  style="color:#1f6feb; margin-top:0; ">Myth #7: Your day-to-day job will be boring.</h2>
    <div style="  padding:16px; margin:8px 0 16px;">
      <p style="color:black; margin:0 0 12px 0;">
        Developers wear many hats: problem solver, analyst, designer, tester. It’s creative and challenging; you have room to grow and explore.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Myth 8 -->
    <h2  style="color:#1f6feb; margin-top:0; ">Myth #8: Your job will always be exciting and challenging.</h2>
    <div style="    padding:16px; margin:8px 0 16px;">
      <p style="color:black; margin:0 0 12px 0;">
        Some days are thrilling; others are repetitive. You’ll juggle projects, fix builds, and sit through all-hands. The good days outweigh the bad.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Myth 9 -->
    <h2 s style="color:#1f6feb; margin-top:0; ">Myth #9: All software developers work in offices.</h2>
    <div style="    padding:16px; margin:8px 0 16px;">
      <p style="color:black; margin:0 0 12px 0;">
        While some work in traditional offices, remote and hybrid work are common. With the internet and cloud tools, you can contribute from almost anywhere.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Myth 10 -->
    <h2  style="color:#1f6feb; margin-top:0;  ">Myth #10: All software developers work on big projects.</h2>
    <div style="   padding:16px; margin:8px 0 16px;">
      <p style="color:black; margin:0 0 12px 0;">
        Developers build everything from tiny tools to massive platforms—freelance gigs, startups, SMBs, enterprises, and personal projects all count.
      </p>

      <h1 style="margin: 0;">Debunking Software Development Myths</h1>
      <p style="margin: 8px 0 0; color: #000;">Now that we have broken the stereotypes about becoming a programmer, let's debunk some software development myths.</p>
    </header>

    <!-- Myth 1 -->
    <section style="  padding: 16px; margin-top: 16px;  ">
      <h2 style="margin-top: 0;">Myth #1: Software development means writing a lot of source code</h2>
      <p style="color: #000;">Indeed, typing code is important. Yet there are plenty of other activities involved in the software development process.</p>

      <h3 style="margin-bottom: 8px;">Other Activities</h3>
      <ul style="color: #000; margin-top: 0;">
        <li>
          <strong>Meetings.</strong>
          <span>They may eat up a significant portion of a software developer's workday. Whether we like it or not, meetings will happen. Team habits, company culture, the chosen development methodology, and various other factors can influence the length and frequency of meetings.</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Communication.</strong>
          <span>You'll need to respond to emails, phone calls, messages on Slack, Skype and so on. Also, agile methodologies require a fair amount of communication between team members.</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Software quality assurance.</strong>
          <span>You'll implement and execute all kinds of tests, for example, unit tests, performance tests, usability tests, user interface tests, and so on.</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Documentation.</strong>
          <span>Writing and reviewing documents is also an integral part of a software developer's work. For instance, you'll need to document your code. It may sound boring at first, but code comments, if done right, are one of the most useful resources produced by developers for developers. Trying to find out what code actually does can become a daunting task if there are zero comments. As your job responsibilities grow, you'll need to write various technical documents like developer guides or design documents.</span>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p style="color: #000; margin-bottom: 0;">I'm going to talk in more detail about some of these activities in the upcoming module.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Myth 2 -->
    <section style=" padding: 16px; margin-top: 16px;  ">
      <h2 style="margin-top: 0;">Myth #2: Customers always know what they want</h2>
      <p style="color: #000;">Contrary to popular belief, this is rarely the case. In many projects, clients come with only a nebulous idea of their desired product, which can lead to significant challenges.</p>

      <h3 style="margin-bottom: 8px;">Example: Vague Job Posting (rendered as code)</h3>
      <p  style="  background: #f7f7f7; padding: 12px;    color: #000;">
   Upwork Posting (sample)
  "Need app like Uber but different. Budget flexible. Time ASAP.
 Should work on iOS/Android/Web. Must be secure.
  Looking for best price."
 </p>

      <h3 style="margin-bottom: 8px;">How to Handle It</h3>
      <ol style="color: #000;">
        <li><strong>Create draft plans and visual mockups</strong> before implementing. This saves time, energy, and frustration.</li>
        <li><strong>Have frequent checkpoints and reviews</strong> with the customer so the software evolves as envisioned. If misunderstandings occur, you only discard work since the last review.</li>
        <li><strong>Be honest</strong> about factors that affect scope, deadlines, and budget&mdash;unexpected issues, technical debt, or resource shortages.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <!-- Myth 3 -->
    <section style="  padding: 16px; margin-top: 16px;  ">
      <h2 style="margin-top: 0;">Myth #3: Software estimates are highly precise</h2>
      <p style="color: #000;">It's a common misconception that development timelines can be estimated with high accuracy. Estimations are crucial because they guide decisions for both the client and the development team, but they are inherently uncertain.</p>

       
      <p style="color: #000;">Treat estimates as ranges, revisit them at checkpoints, and communicate uncertainty early.</p>

    <h2> Activities Involved in Software Development</h2>

    <p style="color: black; margin:12px 0; padding:10px;  ">
      software development is more than just writing code.
    </p>

    <p style="color: black; margin:12px 0; padding:10px;  ">
      It involves numerous activities that come together to create a functional product.
    </p>

   <p style="color: black; margin:12px 0; padding:10px;  ">
    Let's have a closer look at the most frequent activities involved in the process of creating software products. 
 </p>

    <h4>- Collecting and Analyzing Requirements</h4>
    <p style="color: black; margin:12px 0; padding:10px;  ">
      Requirements can come from various sources. A customer's vision, a colleague's input, or another team's feedback.
      They might range from crystal clear to utterly nebulous. In a recent project, we navigated through a maze of vague client
      requests to finally understand and deliver exactly what was needed.
    </p>

    <h4>- Validating Ideas and Performing Feasibility Studies</h4>
    <p style="color: black; margin:12px 0; padding:10px;  ">
      Even with clear requirements, some ideas might not be technically feasible. Constraints like technology limitations,
      resource availability, or expertise gaps can be roadblocks. It's crucial to assess the viability of these ideas early on.
      Remember, a seemingly straightforward request can turn into a Herculean task if not vetted for feasibility.
     
  
      For instance, we once had to shelve an innovative feature due to resource constraints — a tough but necessary decision.
    </p>

    <h4>- Defining the Architecture</h4>
    <p style="color: black; margin:12px 0; padding:10px;  ">
      Architecting a software system is akin to drafting a building's blueprint. It involves outlining the structure and interactions
      between components, creating prototypes, and doing proof of concept. Work is sometimes required, especially if the team has no
      prior experience with a given technology.
     
      For example, while working on a cloud based application, we had to prototype extensively to ensure our architecture could handle
      the anticipated load.
    </p>

    <h4>- Implementation and Testing</h4>
    <p style="color: black; margin:12px 0; padding:10px;  ">
      Coding is accompanied by rigorous testing, a vital step often underestimated. It's like double checking every piece of a puzzle.
      Testing ensures all parts fit perfectly, avoiding surprises later. Writing unit tests and conducting thorough checks are essential
      to catch major bugs.
     
     
      A lesson learned from a past project was that an overlooked minor bug in the early stages can evolve into a major headache later.
    </p>

    <h4>- Creating Documentation and Guides</h4>
    <p style="color: black; margin:12px 0; padding:10px;  ">
      The type and extent of documentation vary by project and methodology from API guides to user manuals. Documents are the unsung heroes,
      supporting both developers and end users.
      
      In one of our agile projects, well-maintained documentation significantly eased the onboarding of new team members. It was like a treasure
      map, guiding them through the project's complexities.
    </p>

    <h4>- Release, Support, and Maintenance</h4>
    <p style="color: black; margin:12px 0; padding:10px;  ">
      Post release, the focus shifts to support and maintenance. This phase is never static. It's an ongoing conversation with the users where
      their feedback shapes the software's evolution.
     
      For instance, shortly after releasing one of my mobile apps, I had to quickly adapt to unexpected user behavior, leading to a significant
      but necessary update.
    
      Each of these activities is a critical cog in the vast machinery of software development. Understanding their nuances and interplay is key to
      successful project execution.
     
      As we navigate through these activities, we're not just building software, we're crafting a solution that evolves with its users' needs.
    </p>

<h1 style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:12px; color:#1f6feb;"> Why Understanding Software Development Roles is Important</h1>
    <!-- Intro paragraph (font color forced to black via inline CSS) -->
    <p style="color: black; line-height:1.6;">  we will demystify the technical hands-on roles in a typical software development team. Why is that important, you ask?</p>

    <p style="color: black; line-height:1.6;">Simple.</p>

    <p style="color: black; line-height:1.6;">When you know the responsibilities, daily tasks and career paths for each role, you can make an informed choice about where you see yourself fitting in.</p>

    <h2 style="color:#1f6feb; margin-top:20px;">Picture this.</h2>

    <p style="color: black; line-height:1.6;">You are at a musical concert and every musician plays a unique instrument: guitar, drums, keyboard, you name it.</p>

    <p style="color: black; line-height:1.6;">Now, each of these musicians has a role and they need to play their part well for the entire show to be a hit.</p>

    <p style="color: black; line-height:1.6;">The software industry works in a similar way.</p>

    <p style="color: black; line-height:1.6;">Whether you are coding, testing, or writing the documents, everyone has a role to play. Understanding these roles will help you choose the one that fits you best.</p>

    <h2 style="color:#1f6feb; margin-top:20px;">Scope</h2>

    <p style="color: black; line-height:1.6;">Since our focus here is on the technical roles, we won't be going down the rabbit hole of management positions. Those can be complex and are generally future steps once you've got your feet wet.</p>

    <h2 style="color:#1f6feb; margin-top:20px;">For each role, we'll discuss</h2>

    <ul style="color: black; line-height:1.8;">
      <li style="color: black;">Responsibilities — The nitty gritty of what you'll be doing day to day.</li>
      <li style="color: black;">A day in the life — A sneak peek into how your work day might look.</li>
      <li style="color: black;">Career steps — How to land that role and what you will need.</li>
      <li style="color: black;">Pros and cons — What to consider if you are eyeing that role.</li>
      <li style="color: black;">Future career opportunities — where you could potentially go from there.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="color:#1f6feb; margin-top:20px;">Order of topics</h2>

    <p style="color: black; line-height:1.6;">We will start with entry level positions such as internships and junior developer roles, and then move on to more advanced positions like software tester, technical writer, and so on.</p>

     
  </div>

<div style="border: 2px solid #333; border-radius:10px; padding:24px; background:#fff; max-width:900px; margin:0 auto;">

    <h1 style="color:#1f6feb; margin-top:0;">Internship: Your First Step into Software Development </h1>

    <p style="color:black; line-height:1.6;"> We've all got to start somewhere, right? And in today's tech world, that somewhere is often an internship.</p>
    <p style="color:black; line-height:1.6;">It's like a playground for grown ups. Just swap out the swings and slides for keyboards and code.</p>
    <p style="color:black; line-height:1.6;">So, let's unravel what an internship is all about.</p>

    <p style="color:black; line-height:1.6;">Your main task as an intern is to be a learning machine. You will be dipping your toes into coding, teamwork, software tools, and even customer interactions. Expect to work on smaller tasks, maybe bugs, and if you are doing well, even a mini-feature.</p>
    <p style="color:black; line-height:1.6;">Imagine walking into the office or logging in virtually for a quick morning huddle with your team. You get an assignment that is manageable but challenges you to stretch your skills. Then you dive into coding, testing, and asking for feedback. And yes, expect a lot of coffee or tea.</p>

    <h2 style="color:#1f6feb;">How to get your foot in the door</h2>
    <p style="color:black; line-height:1.6;">Arm yourself with core programming skills and a willingness to learn. Your next step is to find the internships themselves. Check out company websites under their 'Careers' section. You might find they are actively looking for interns. Don't overlook social media platforms, particularly LinkedIn, and if you are in college or university, keep an eye out on the career boards and listen for announcements. These places often have partnerships with tech companies, which can give you an easier path in.</p>

    <p style="color:black; line-height:1.6;">Once you spot an opportunity, it's time to hustle. Tailor your resume to reflect any relevant experience or skills, and draft a cover letter that shows your enthusiasm and understanding of the company. Open source contributions or a compelling portfolio can make you stand out. Submit your application and prepare for an interview. Some companies might even ask you to solve a coding problem or two, so keep your skills sharp.</p>

    <h2 style="color:#1f6feb;">Pros and cons of internships</h2>
    <p style="color:black; line-height:1.6;">On the plus side, you will get hands-on real-world experience that a classroom just can't offer. Trust me, there is no better classroom than an actual workplace to understand what corporate life is all about. And let's not forget about networking. You will rub elbows with people who've been in the game for a while. These connections can be your career guides, giving you advice that's worth its weight in gold. In fact, sometimes a successful internship can even open the door to a fulltime job. I've seen it happen and it's awesome.</p>

    <p style="color:black; line-height:1.6;">But hold on, it's not all sunshine and rainbows. One major downside is the money or lack of it, to be precise. Many internships won't pay you or they might offer just a small stipend. Remember, though, that you're trading that for experience and a solid entry on your CV. Also, be prepared for some less-than-glamorous tasks. You might find yourself doing work that's not exactly the stuff of dreams. That's just part of the learning curve. And keep in mind, internships usually have an expiration date. Most last just a few months, so you will need to think about your next move. It's like a short, intense course in 'What am I Getting Myself into 101.'</p>

    <h2 style="color:#1f6feb;">Future career opportunities</h2>
    <p style="color:black; line-height:1.6;">When it comes to future career opportunities, an internship is like a launchpad. You could go on to become a junior developer or veer into specialized roles like testing or data analysis. It's wide open from here.</p>

     
  </div>

 <div style="border: 2px solid #333; border-radius:10px; padding:24px; background:#fff; max-width:900px; margin:0 auto;">

    <h1 style="color:#1f6feb; margin-top:0;"> the role of a junior developer.</h1>

    <p style="color:black; line-height:1.6;"> All right, let's move on to the role of a junior developer.Trust me, it's not just a title for newbies or coding amateurs. It's an essential position that carries its own set of responsibilities.</p>
    <p style="color:black; line-height:1.6;">So what does a junior developer do? In a nutshell, you will be writing code, debugging, and learning the ropes. You are the apprentice learning from the masters if you will.</p>
    <p style="color:black; line-height:1.6;">You will spend time reviewing your code with other developers, learning from their feedback, and gradually improving your skills. Often you will be paired with a senior developer who will act as a mentor, providing guidance and helping you solve problems that come up.</p>

    <h2 style="color:#1f6feb;">A day in the life</h2>
    <p style="color:black; line-height:1.6;">Imagine a mix of coding sessions, team meetings, and yes, quite a bit of Googling or StackOverflow-ing. You're learning as you go and that's completely fine. Just remember: the more challenges you tackle, the faster you will grow.</p>

    <h2 style="color:#1f6feb;">How to become a junior developer</h2>
    <p style="color:black; line-height:1.6;">Well, you don't necessarily need a degree in computer science, but it helps. Certifications, bootcamps, and a portfolio to show off your skills can also go a long way. And don't forget internships. They can be your golden ticket into a junior role.</p>

    <h2 style="color:#1f6feb;">Pros and cons</h2>
    <p style="color:black; line-height:1.6;">On the upside, you're gaining crucial experience and honing your skills. It's like a playground where you learn the rules of the game from experienced developers, and usually it's a pretty supportive environment. Also, unlike interns, you will actually get paid.</p>
    <p style="color:black; line-height:1.6;">On the flip side, the salary won't be a top tier yet. The tasks might sometimes feel repetitive and the workload can be quite heavy at times. But hey, you've got to start somewhere, right? Being a junior dev can be tough, but stick with it, and you will not only get better, but also open doors to further career opportunities.</p>

    <h2 style="color:#1f6feb;">Future career opportunities</h2>
    <p style="color:black; line-height:1.6;">Becoming a junior developer is your first significant step on the career ladder. From here, you can work your way up to a senior developer or software architect role. Specialize in a certain area like front-end or back-end development, or even cross over into roles like DevOps Engineer or System Analyst. Your experience as a junior dev will be the springboard for whatever you choose to do next.</p>

<h2 style=" padding: 12px;   margin-bottom: 10px;">Senior Developer: A Maestro of Code</h2>

<p style="color: black;   padding: 12px;   margin-bottom: 10px;">
Let's explore the role of a senior developer, a position that combines experience and technical skills
with mentoring and strategy.
</p>

<p style="color: black;   padding: 12px;   margin-bottom: 10px;">
In this role, you'll be expected to go beyond coding to guide your team and contribute to architectural
decisions.
</p>

<p style="color: black;   padding: 12px;   margin-bottom: 10px;">
At the senior level, you are not just coding, you are leading.
Your duties expand beyond just writing software.
You are now responsible for architectural decisions, code reviews and often mentorship of junior devs.
Basically, you are the go-to person when things get tangled in code.
</p>

<p style="color: black;   padding: 12px;   margin-bottom: 10px;">
Your day might begin with a project management meeting discussing milestones and deadlines.
Unlike junior devs, you are not just receiving tasks, you are helping to decide what those tasks should be.
You will spend your day diving into complex coding problems, reviewing code, and probably doing less Googling than before.
By now, you should be the one writing the guides, not just reading them.
</p>

<p style="color: black;   padding: 12px;  margin-bottom: 10px;">
Getting to this point has involved a lot of hard work, experience, and continuous learning.
You probably have at least a few years of experience under your belt, and have demonstrated expertise
in your chosen tech stack.
</p>

<p style="color: black;   padding: 12px;   margin-bottom: 10px;">
Before we dive into the pros and cons, let me be upfront.
I want to share a balanced view here.
It's not all rainbows and sunshine, nor is it all doom and gloom.
</p>

<h3 style="  padding: 12px;  margin-bottom: 10px;">First up, let's talk money.</h3>
<p style="color:   padding: 12px;   margin-bottom: 10px;">
As a senior dev, your paycheck reflects your experience.
You've earned it.
</p>

<p style="color: black;  padding: 12px;   margin-bottom: 10px;">
Next, you get to have a real say in how things are done.
You are part of the decision-making process, influencing the direction of projects.
And let's not forget about freedom.
Yes, you get to turn your ideas into code without as much red tape.
</p>

<h3 style="  padding: 12px;   margin-bottom: 10px;">Now, the flip side.</h3>
<p style="color: black;   padding: 12px;   margin-bottom: 10px;">
The project's success – that responsibility is on you.
You are the one the manager calls when things get rough.
</p>

<p style="color: black;   padding: 12px;   margin-bottom: 10px;">
Another thing, you might find yourself stuck in meetings rather than actually coding.
It's part of the job, but it can be a drag. 
And a heads-up: work-life balance can get a bit shaky.
You might end up working when you'd rather be relaxing.
</p>

  <h1 style="margin-bottom:12px;">Technical Writer — Career Overview</h1>

  <p style="color: black;   padding:12px; margin:10px 0; background:#fff;">
    If you have strong grammar skills and a passion for technology, a career as a technical writer may
    be the perfect entry point into the software development industry.
  </p>

  <p style="color: black;   padding:12px; margin:10px 0; background:#fff;">
    As a technical writer, you play a crucial role in making sure that the complicated world of software
    is easy to understand for everyone.
  </p>

  <p style="color: black;   padding:12px; margin:10px 0; background:#fff;">
    You'll be collaborating with developers, UX designers, and customer support teams to create guides,
    FAQs, and even error messages that make sense.
  </p>

  <p style="color: black;   padding:12px; margin:10px 0; background:#fff;">
    You might not appreciate the genius of a good technical writer until you find yourself in a frustrating
    situation like this.
  </p>

  <h2 style="margin-top:18px;">The Day the Drone Arrived</h2>

  <p style="color: black;   padding:12px; margin:10px 0; background:#fff;">
    The day has come.
  </p>

  <p style="color: black;   padding:12px; margin:10px 0; background:#fff;">
    That drone you couldn't resist buying during that once in a lifetime sale has finally arrived.
    "What a steal!" - you thought when you clicked "Purchase." You can't wait to open the box and send it soaring into the sky.
  </p>

  <p style="color: black;   padding:12px; margin:10px 0; background:#fff;">
    The drone feels a bit cheap and flimsy, and the controller has a ton of buttons. The initial excitement slowly turns into disappointment, but then you find the instruction manual. What a relief!
  </p>

  <p style="color: black;   padding:12px; margin:10px 0; background:#fff;">
    You flip through the pages until you find the section titled <strong>First Takeoff</strong>.
    Okay, here we go.
  </p>

  <p style="color: black;   padding:12px; margin:10px 0; background:#fff;">
    "Very much flying to sky<br>button press fast."
  </p>

  <p style="color: black;   padding:12px; margin:10px 0; background:#fff;">
    What? You spend half the day in a futile attempt to decode this mess. Finally, you give up, rebox the drone and return it. This is what happens when companies underestimate the importance of a good technical writer.
  </p>

  <h2 style="margin-top:18px;">A Day in the Life</h2>

  <p style="color: black;   padding:12px; margin:10px 0; background:#fff;">
    A day in your life as a tech writer could start like this:

  <p style="color: black;   padding:12px; margin:10px 0; background:#fff;">
    You are sipping your morning coffee when you receive an email about a brand new feature that's about
    to be rolled out soon.
  </p>

  <p style="color: black;   padding:12px; margin:10px 0; background:#fff;">
    Your job? Make it understandable for the end users, and maybe even for the developers who will maintain it later.
  </p>

  <p style="color: black;   padding:12px; margin:10px 0; background:#fff;">
    You spend your days switching between meetings with developers, diving deep into the software, and then translating technical jargon into human-friendly language. You're a bit like a detective and a poet all rolled into one.
  </p>

  <h2 style="margin-top:18px;">How to Break In</h2>

  <p style="color: black;   padding:12px; margin:10px 0; background:#fff;">
    To break into this role, a background in writing, journalism, or communication is often a good start, but you'll also need to have a knack for technical subjects.
  </p>

  <p style="color: black;   padding:12px; margin:10px 0; background:#fff;">
    An English major who loves to code on the side? Perfect! Many tech companies value technical writers who can speak developer but also understand the user's point of view.
  </p>

  <p style="color: black;   padding:12px; margin:10px 0; background:#fff;">
    You might even start as a junior developer or QA tester and realize that documentation is your true calling.
  </p>

  <h2 style="margin-top:18px;">Pros & Cons</h2>

  <p style="color: black;   padding:12px; margin:10px 0; background:#fff;">
    Now let's talk about the upsides and downsides of being a technical writer.
  </p>

  <h3 style="margin-top:12px;">Pros</h3>
  <p style="color: black;   padding:12px; margin:10px 0; background:#fff;">
    Your work is always changing. You're dealing with different topics, different formats and different teams. It's definitely not monotonous. You'll also have a pretty big impact. You're the one making the software user friendly. You will combine your love of writing with your interest in tech.
  </p>

  <h3 style="margin-top:12px;">Cons</h3>
  <p style="color: black;   padding:12px; margin:10px 0; background:#fff;">
    You will often find yourself racing against the clock. Deadlines can be tight, especially when you're waiting on other folks to give you the info you need. And while your work is crucial, you might not always get the spotlight you deserve. Last but not least, it's a bit of a juggling act. Striking a balance between too technical and too simple can be a challenge.
  </p>

  <h2 style="margin-top:18px;">Career Growth</h2>

  <p style="color: black;   padding:12px; margin:10px 0; background:#fff;">
    Technical writers with a desire to advance have options. You might specialize into complex topics like API documentation or even venture into UX design, leveraging your understanding of user-centric content in larger organizations.
  </p>

  <p style="color: black;   padding:12px; margin:10px 0 30px 0; background:#fff;">
    A documentation manager role can come into play overseeing larger documentation projects and teams.
  </p>

  <p style="color: black;   padding:12px; margin:10px 0; background:#fff;">
    There you have it. If you're a whiz at making the complicated straightforward, technical writing might just be the entry
    role you've been looking for in the tech field. And who knows, you might be the one saving someone from a drone disaster one day.

<h1>Software Architect — The Next Step</h1>

<p style="color:black;   padding:10px;  ">After progressing from junior to senior developer roles, you may be wondering about your next step. The role of a software architect is a great opportunity to exercise your visionary skills, and it often overlaps with the responsibilities of a senior developer.</p>
<p style="color:black; border:1px solid #ccc; padding:10px; background-color:white;">Sound interesting? Let's explore it together.</p>

<h2>What a Software Architect Does</h2>
<p style="color:black;   padding:10px;  ">The software architect is like the architect of a building. You're responsible for creating the blueprint, the technical design that the dev team will use to construct the software. Your role is to think big, designing the structure, identifying the components and defining how they all interact.</p>
<p style="color:black;   padding:10px;  ">You often decide which frameworks, technologies, and approaches the team will use. You are the go-to person for ensuring technical soundness and integrity.</p>

<h2>A Typical Day</h2>
<p style="color:black;   padding:10px;  ">You might spend your day discussing technical requirements, researching new technologies, sketching out architectural diagrams, reviewing code and yes, still doing a bit of coding yourself. You're the bridge between the business needs and the technical aspects of a project. Expect a lot of meetings with product owners, stakeholders, and your dev team. Trust me, it's a juggling act.</p>

<h2>How to Get There</h2>
<p style="color:black;   padding:10px;   ">Typically, you'd move into this role after gaining a few years of experience as a senior developer. But on top of that, you will need a deep understanding of software design principles, a knack for problem solving, and great communication skills.</p>

<h2>Pros and Cons</h2>
<h3>Pros</h3>
<ul style="color:black;   padding:10px;  ">
  <li>You're the master planner, the visionary, and it's rewarding to see a project come to life based on your designs.</li>
  <li>Architecting a project from the ground up can be immensely satisfying.</li>
  <li>You are the technical face of the team and your decisions hold weight.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cons</h3>
<ul style="color:black;  padding:10px;  ">
  <li>Your decisions can make or break a project. Mistakes at the architectural level can be costly to fix later.</li>
  <li>Since your role often blends with that of a senior developer, expect some overlap in responsibilities.</li>
  <li>Depending on your decisions, you can either be the hero or the villain.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Personal Reflection</h2>
<p style="color:black;   padding:10px;  ">As someone who has worked as a software architect, I can totally relate to the challenges that come with decision making. It's like having a crystal ball and having to pick between equally tempting technical options, each with its own set of pros and cons.</p>
 At times, you may feel like a superstar, but at other times you may become the subject of complaints. Every small design choice you make can lead to significant changes in the code. On the other hand, if you decide to put off a decision, it could create problems for you later on.</p>
  So yes, the role gives you a lot of authority, but with great power comes great responsibility.</p>

<h2>Career Growth</h2>
<p style="color:black;   padding:10px;  ">As a software architect, you are pretty high up the food chain, but there's always room to grow. Some people transition into executive roles like chief technology officer or other high ranking managerial positions. Others become industry consultants or experts in particular architectures or technologies.</p>

  <h2>role of system analyst </h2>

  <p style="color:black;">
   Now let's talk about the system analyst. The system analyst is the person who bridges the gap between what the business needs and how technology
    can solve those needs.
  </p>

  <p style="color:black;">
    As a system analyst, your primary responsibility is to act as a mediator between the business and development
    teams. Your job is to translate business requirements into a language that developers can understand.
  </p>

  <p style="color:black;">
    You may also conduct feasibility studies, estimate costs, and even manage projects at times.
    Your morning likely starts with meetings with business stakeholders.
    You are the link between business needs and the tech solutions that meet them.
  </p>

  <p style="color:black;">
    These meetings are about listening, asking questions, and gathering requirements. After that, you head back to your desk
    to create technical specifications or requirements documents.
  </p>

  <p style="color:black;">
    You are not just writing down what you heard. You're analyzing — maybe even running some data models — to turn business needs
    into actionable steps for the development team.
  </p>

  <p style="color:black;">
    Then you likely spend time reviewing existing systems, coordinating with project managers, and taking
    part in quality assurance processes to make sure the end product is in sync with the original vision.
  </p>

  <p style="color:black;">
    It's a complex role that blends soft skills with technical expertise. Most system analysts come from a business or tech background.
    You could start off in a junior role after obtaining a relevant degree or transition from a related role, like quality assurance.
  </p>

  <h3>  advantages and disadvantages to this position.</h3>

  <h4>Pros.</h4>
  <ul>
    <li style="color:black;">You're not confined to a desk.</li>
    <li style="color:black;">You interact with different departments.</li>
    <li style="color:black;">Your work directly impacts the success of projects.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Cons.</h4>
  <ul>
    <li style="color:black;">Deadlines are real and sometimes tight.</li>
    <li style="color:black;">Your recommendations can make or break a project.</li>
  </ul>

  <p style="color:black;">
    As a system analyst, your next step could be moving into managerial or strategic roles where you'd
    oversee larger projects or even entire departments. You could also transition into consultancy, where your broad understanding
    of systems and business processes is highly valuable.

  <h2>Management roles  .</h2>

  <p style="color:black;">
    Management roles serve as coordinators in software development. Although not directly involved in design, coding or testing, their responsibilities are crucial in
    ensuring the project's success.
  </p>

  <h3>Dispelling prevalent myths.</h3>

  <h4>Perpetual meetings.</h4>
  <p style="color:black;">
    While it's true that managers participate in numerous meetings, these gatherings are essential for
    decision-making and strategic planning.
  </p>
  <p style="color:black;">
    These meetings are crucial for staying updated with their teams, business partners, stakeholders,
    and key customers.
  </p>
  <p style="color:black;">
    Depending on their role, managers also have to deal with unexpected challenges in business, legal
    and technology fields.
  </p>
  <p style="color:black;">
    This is why they need to interact with a diverse set of people, and why their schedules often include
    significant travel.
  </p>
  <p style="color:black;">
    It's not just about being busy. It's about being deeply involved in every aspect that affects their projects and teams.
  </p>

  <h4>Detached leadership.</h4>
  <p style="color:black;">
    Contrary to popular belief, effective managers are highly invested in the success of a project and are far from being disengaged.
  </p>
  <p style="color:black;">
    Sure, they might have their own offices, though this is becoming less common, but that doesn't mean
    they are out of touch.
  </p>
  <p style="color:black;">
    Any role that deals with sensitive information, intricate planning, or requires periods of intense
    focus benefits from a bit of solitude.
  </p>
  <p style="color:black;">
    Just like a writer needs a quiet room to come up with good stories, or a coder needs uninterrupted
    time to solve complex problems, managers use these spaces to strategize and connect the dots for the bigger picture.
  </p>
  <p style="color:black;">
    It's not about being isolated, it's about creating a space where they can be most effective for their
    team and the projects at hand.
  </p>

  <h4>Authoritarian figures.</h4>
  <p style="color:black;">
    The idea that managers exist solely to impose strict rules or create obstacles is mostly a myth.
  </p>
  <p style="color:black;">
    I'm not saying that all managers are perfect, or that every decision they make is spot on, but their
    main job isn't just about being strict or creating problems, but more about helping their teams thrive.
  </p>
  <p style="color:black;">
    It's a bit like a coach who is there to help the team play better, not just blow the whistle when something goes wrong.
  </p>

  <h3>Bottom line</h3>
  <p style="color:black;">
    The management role is multifaceted and indispensable for the overall success of a project.
  </p>

    You wouldn’t start cooking a meal without a recipe. Similarly, the development of a software product also requires some sort of step-by-step plan.
  </p>

  <p style="color: black;   padding: 12px; margin: 10px 0;  ">
    The process which describes the steps needed to build the software from start to finish is what we call software development methodology.
  </p>

  <p style="color: black;   padding: 12px; margin: 10px 0;  ">
    Like cooking a meal without a recipe, ad-hoc software development leads to problems.
  </p>

  <p style="color: black;   padding: 12px; margin: 10px 0;  ">
    Without a plan the software quality will suffer, deadlines won’t be met and costs will get out of control.
  </p>

  <p style="color: black;   padding: 12px; margin: 10px 0;  ">
    Thus, every software development company or startup uses a development process.
  </p>

  <p style="color: black;   padding: 12px; margin: 10px 0;  ">
    Over time, many different methodologies have been invented.
  </p>

  <p style="color: black;   padding: 12px; margin: 10px 0;  ">
    Since projects have different needs, choosing the right approach is not always an easy decision to be made.
  </p>

  <p style="color: black;   padding: 12px; margin: 10px 0;  ">
    In the upcoming lectures, we’re going to talk about the plan-driven Waterfall model and the change-friendly Agile approach.
  </p>

  <p style="color: black;   padding: 12px; margin: 10px 0;  ">
    Here’s a formal definition: A software development methodology describes how to organize the activities involved in the software development process.
  </p>

  <p style="color: black;  padding: 12px; margin: 10px 0;  ">
    To summarize: software development methodologies are collections of best practices. By applying these practices, your project will go smoother and you’ll increase the chance of completing it.
  </p>
</div>

<div style="border:2px solid #000; border-radius:8px; padding:18px; max-width:900px; margin:24px auto; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height:1.6;">

 <h2>The Waterfall   model.</h2>

  <p style="color: black; margin:12px 0;">
   The Waterfall is a linear model. It defines development steps or phases.
  </p>

  <p style="color: black; margin:12px 0;">
    You start executing one step, complete it and then start the next one.
  </p>

  <p style="color: black; margin:12px 0;">
    This approach gives us a steady, downward order - hence the name "Waterfall." The development process flows in cascades. Each development phase requires the previous one to be completed.
  </p>

  <h3>Let’s talk a bit about these phases.</h3>

  <p style="color: black; margin:12px 0;">
    First, we collect and analyze the requirements. The expected functionality of the future application must be clarified with the stakeholders. All the details must be documented thoroughly. This very first phase is probably the most important one. When done right, the Waterfall model will produce the expected outcome.
  </p>

  <p style="color: black; margin:12px 0;">
    After collecting and analyzing the requirements, we can proceed to the next phase. Here’s where we define the overall design of our software. Defining the architecture is like creating the blueprint for a building. Thus, the design should be as clear and detailed as possible. The bottom line is this: the team should be able to implement the product based on this plan.
  </p>

  <p style="color: black; margin:12px 0;">
    We should address questions like: "Which packages or components will form our system?" "What are the fundamental types of each component?" "How do these types interact with each other to achieve the required functionality?" "Is our software secure?" "How about performance?" "How does our software respond to errors?" "How do we handle edge cases?" "Should we extend our system in the future?" "Which third-party components do we use?" And the list can grow or shrink depending on the requirements we defined in the previous phase.
  </p>

  <p style="color: black; margin:12px 0;">
    The implementation comes next. The software development phase is usually divided into smaller units. Each unit is then implemented and tested by developers. Once the development phase is completed, the product undergoes the verification phase.
  </p>

  <p style="color: black; margin:12px 0;">
    During this step, the software is evaluated based on predefined criteria. We must check whether the product provides the functionality we agreed on. Tests are executed to ensure that the software works as expected. We test for functional, performance, security and usability issues. Detected problems are recorded and fixed. The process goes on until all severe bugs are fixed.
  </p>

  <p style="color: black; margin:12px 0;">
    The verification phase may also bring to surface deeper bugs and critical issues that may affect the planned release. As soon as the testing phase completes and the given version is delivered, the software enters the maintenance phase.
  </p>

  <p style="color: black; margin:12px 0;">
    By definition, the maintenance phase is about fixing smaller bugs. But more often than not, it may also include functional enhancements. The client may come up with new requirements that involve substantial changes. You may feel tempted to squeeze in “just one more patch” in the maintenance phase. Now, this is usually a bad idea. In this case, we need to set up a new waterfall project and repeat all the steps.
  </p>

  <p style="color: black; margin:12px 0;">
    The Waterfall model is used for life-control, medical and military systems. This model requires us to clarify all the requirements and create a detailed plan upfront. We can use the Waterfall if all requirements are precisely defined and won’t change over time.
  </p>

  <p style="color: black; margin:12px 0;">
    The Waterfall has received some well-deserved criticism for its inability to respond to changes. Due to its linear structure, new requirements can’t be considered at later phases of the development process. If the client changes their mind frequently, or our design misses essential aspects, we’re going to hit problems during development or testing. In such cases, we should follow a different approach.
  </p>
</div>
 
<div style="border:2px solid #000; border-radius:8px; padding:18px; max-width:900px; margin:24px auto; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height:1.6;">

      <h2>  pros and cons of the Waterfall model.</h2>
  

  <p style="color: black; margin:12px 0;">
  we're going to talk about the pros and cons 
   of the Waterfall model.   Let’s first see the benefits of using the Waterfall. This model requires clarity on almost every detail before writing a single line of code. This approach has a huge benefit. The detailed design document leaves no room for misunderstandings.
  </p>

  <p style="color: black; margin:12px 0;">
    In order to come up with a detailed design, the architect has to perform a thorough analysis on all the features and requirements for the given the software product. While this can be challenging and time-consuming, it has the benefits of spotting most of the issues that otherwise may appear later.
  </p>

  <p style="color: black; margin:12px 0;">
    By identifying the problems early on, we can reduce redesign and bug-fix costs at later stages. Note however, that no methodology can guarantee bug-free software.
  </p>

  <p style="color: black; margin:12px 0;">
    The other benefit of having a detailed, up-to-date design document is that information is not lost. The team setup usually changes over time. Imagine what happened if the senior architect, who was in charge to oversee the entire software project, suddenly leaves the company.
  </p>

  <p style="color: black; margin:12px 0;">
    If all the knowledge were only in his head, those who take over the project would have to reverse-engineer the project based on the source code. For large, complex projects this may take up to several weeks!
  </p>

  <p style="color: black; margin:12px 0;">
    The Waterfall Model is not well-suited for abrupt changes. It is based on the assumption that both the requirements and the design can be defined at early stages. This can lead to carving in stone some assumptions which may become obsolete later on.
  </p>

  <p style="color: black; margin:12px 0;">
    The customer may change their mind and ask for new features that do not fit well in the original set of features. A customer who precisely knows what they want is every software professional’s dream to come true. Unfortunately, this rarely happens in real life.
  </p>

  <p style="color: black; margin:12px 0;">
    Deciphering what the customers really want can be more challenging than you’d imagine. Therefore, coming up with a precise and clear set of requirements is time consuming and even impossible in some cases. If the requirements cannot be clarified within a certain amount of time, an Agile methodology may be a better choice.
  </p>

  <p style="color: black; margin:12px 0;">
    Another caveat of the Waterfall model is the big initial investment that is required to create a detailed design. Up to 40% of the overall development time may be spent on architecture definition early in the software development cycle.
  </p>

  <p style="color: black; margin:12px 0;">
    Besides, the development can't go in parallel with the design definition work.
  </p>

  <p style="color: black; margin:12px 0;">
    Now that we know the pros and the cons of the Waterfall model, let’s see what kind of projects is it best suited for. If you know quite exactly what has to be built, then you can safely rely on the Waterfall model. All the pros we brought up will make your life easier.
  </p>

  <p style="color: black; margin:12px 0;">
    You can’t go wrong with the Waterfall if you have a product that is firm and stable. Typically mature or legacy projects which have a stable feature set fall into this category. Go for the Waterfall model if the likelihood of unexpected feature requests is low.
  </p>

  <p style="color: black; margin:12px 0;">
    If the environment your software is using or relying on - like the platform, the SDK, the hardware, follows a stable, predictable path, and every information is available, then you can’t go wrong with the Waterfall.
  </p>

  <p style="color: black; margin:12px 0;">
    For the Waterfall to work, preconditions must be met. This includes the capability to clarify vague requirements, ability to write detailed design documents, in-depth understanding and knowledge of UML and design patterns, quality-awareness and willingness to write clean code based on a design document.
  </p>

    <!-- Heading (no black color applied here as requested) -->
    <h2 style="margin-top:0; padding-bottom:6px;">Agile  methodology  .</h2>

    <!-- All paragraphs / list items have inline color:black -->
    <p style="color:black; margin:8px 0;">
     Agile is a relatively new approach to software project management. 
 It all began with the agile manifesto in 2001. This manifesto was an attempt to end the proliferation of methodologies that had developed.
    </p>

    <p style="color:black; margin:8px 0;">
      The agile manifesto defines four values.
    </p>

    <ul style="color:black; margin:8px 0 16px 20px;">
      <li><strong>Individuals and interactions over the processes and tools.</strong> This doesn't mean that we won't use processes and tools in agile projects. We still need tools and processes, but they shouldn’t prevent us from implementing the required features or changes. Instead of enforcing people to follow a rigid process, we basically implement a process that’s adaptive and responds to changes.</li>

      <li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>Working software over comprehensive documentation.</strong> This doesn't mean that agile projects don't use documentation at all. We should create documentation where it provides value. There’s no need to create extensive documentation just for the sake of it.</li>

      <li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.</strong> Don't get this wrong either. Agile projects also require contracts to manage customer expectations about costs and schedules. But unlike for plan driven projects, there is a spirit of partnership between the development team and the customer. Due to the somewhat uncertain nature of agile projects, both parties acknowledge that some requirements and details may need to be redefined or clarified further as the project progresses. It goes without saying that this kind of partnership requires collaboration and trust.</li>

      <li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>Responding to change over following a plan.</strong> Agile is different from plan-driven approaches, and provides more flexibility compared to the Waterfall model. The major difference is that agile welcomes changes even at the later phases of the development cycle. Some planning is also required for agile projects. But, we don't try to come up with a detailed plan for the entire project prior to starting any development activities. As a consequence we're not blocked until all the requirements are clarified and each and every question gets answered.</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="color:black; margin:8px 0;">
      Now let's talk about how an Agile approach solves the problem we saw with the Waterfall. The main idea behind Agile is that we can deliver functional software iteratively instead of delivering the entire project all at once.
    </p>

    <p style="color:black; margin:8px 0;">
      The work is broken up into shorter chunks called <strong>sprints</strong>. The Sprint is usually two to four weeks long. At the end of each sprint the team should provide something that's an improvement over the previous sprint’s outcome. This interactive approach provides an opportunity to frequently review the product that’s being developed. Stakeholders have a chance to evaluate the software and provide their feedback early on rather than waiting for the final product to be delivered. These frequent checkpoints are super useful as they ensure that the project evolves in the right direction.
    </p>

    <p style="color:black; margin:8px 0;">
      Unlike the waterfall, agile methodologies do not separate testing from development. Testing is tightly integrated with development and the entire team owns the responsibility for the quality of the product. Also involving the business users in the development process stands at the core of agile approaches. There’s a strong relationship between the project team and the stakeholders and business users.
    </p>

    <p style="color:black; margin:8px 0;">
      This model works best in situations where the requirements can't be defined upfront. Agile is a good fit for software projects that are depending on many uncertain factors and changes are to be expected. One of the big benefits of this collaborative model is that it usually leads to higher customer satisfaction. Also, team members will likely be more motivated by engaging customers directly.
    </p>

    <p style="color:black; margin:8px 0;">
      Note that Agile is not a methodology but rather a way of thinking defined by the Agile Manifesto values and principles. Scrum and Kanban are examples of discrete methodologies that implement the agile approach.

    <p style="color:black;"> Let’s talk about the pros and cons of the Agile approach</h1>
 The Agile Model takes an iterative approach to development with regular feedback intervals. This makes it possible to consistently produce quick results.</p>

    <p style="color:black;">These quick iterations give the team the ability to adapt to new requirements or market changes quickly. Obviously abrupt changes need more effort than subtle ones.</p>

    <p style="color:black;">Customers are usually happy for being involved in the software development process. Although this may have additional costs, the benefits are high. The customer can track and influence the evolution of the software product. This guarantees that less amount of work must be thrown away or rolled back if some requirements are misunderstood.</p>

    <h2 style="color:#1e3a8a;">Drawbacks & Pitfalls</h2>

    <p style="color:black;">Agility doesn’t come without some drawbacks and pitfalls, though.</p>

    <p style="color:black;">Estimations are often a guess-work. For large, complex software products, it is challenging to estimate the required time and effort, especially at the beginning of the software development lifecycle. Often, numbers are given based on individual gut-feeling estimates.</p>

    <p style="color:black;">Customer involvement and close collaboration between team members is time-consuming. Besides, team members should have the willingness and skills to properly communicate with the customer and with each other. Members of agile teams should be experienced enough in order to quickly adapt to changes and to be capable of taking the required decisions. So, both professional and soft-skills are needed.</p>

    <p style="color:black;">Although embracing changes stands at the core of the Agile model, frequent and abrupt changes can affect the team’s morale and productivity. The project can easily get off-track if the customer can’t clarify what they want. Too little documentation can lead to maintenance, communication and knowledge sharing issues - especially if key members leave the team.</p>

    <h2 style="color:#1e3a8a;">When Agile Fits Best</h2>

    <p style="color:black;">With all that said, Agile Software Development is well-suited for projects where:</p>

    <ul style="color:black;">
      <li>Requirements are incomplete or can't be clearly defined at early stages of development.</li>
      <li>Scope can change frequently — for example, due to technology/hardware changes, or because the client is undecided.</li>
      <li>Clients must be integrated in the software development process — e.g., the customer triggers some features as they progress with their own product.</li>
      <li>Technology is unknown or not well-documented, and requires a lot of experimenting and proof-of-concept work.</li>
      <li>Customers rarely have the required technical background to precisely define what they want from a software product.</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="color:black;">Therefore, for many project situations, the advantages of agile development outweigh the disadvantages.</p>

 <div style="border:2px solid #444; background:#fff; padding:20px; border-radius:8px; max-width:900px; margin:0 auto; box-shadow:0 6px 18px rgba(0,0,0,0.05);">

    <h1>Waterfall vs Agile</h1>

    <p style="color: #000; line-height:1.6;">Waterfall is usually perceived as rigid and bureaucratic compared to Agile methodologies.</p>

    <p style="color: #000; line-height:1.6;">However, both have their place.</p>

    <p style="color: #000; line-height:1.6;">There are cases where a plan driven methodology won’t work.</p>

    <p style="color: #000; line-height:1.6;">If the level of uncertainty is high and not all questions can be answered right away, then you should probably choose an agile methodology.</p>

    <p style="color: #000; line-height:1.6;">For other projects, a waterfall-like approach will be a better fit. And actually waterfall is still widely used.</p>

    <h2>Examples</h2>

    <p style="color: #000; line-height:1.6;">Let me give you some examples.</p>

    <p style="color: #000; line-height:1.6;">When developing a weapons control system, the requirements should be clarified in advance and need to be stable. Changing the requirements midway would increase the costs considerably - and these kinds of projects are expensive anyway. A Waterfall approach makes perfect sense in this case.</p>

    <p style="color: #000; line-height:1.6;">And here’s another example from Upwork:</p>

    <blockquote style="color:#000; padding:12px 16px; margin:10px 0; border-left:4px solid #ddd; background:#fbfbfb;">
      “Looking to create the next big social media platform for IOS and Android”
    </blockquote>

    <p style="color: #000; line-height:1.6;">Now, coming up with a detailed plan based on assumptions wouldn’t make sense. The description is vague and the customer won’t be able to describe precisely what they need. This high level of uncertainty calls for an agile approach. Creating “the next big social network” will require multiple iterations.</p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>

    <p style="color: #000; line-height:1.6;">So, to sum it up:</p>

    <ul style="color: #000; line-height:1.6;">
      <li>Use the Waterfall when you know what the final product should be, and clients can’t change the scope of the project.</li>
      <li>Use Agile methodologies when there’s a lot of uncertainty involved, the requirements are vague or rapidly changing and clients can’t precisely describe what the end-product should do or look like.</li>
    </ul>

  <h1 style="margin-bottom:16px; font-size:28px;">Scrum Overview</h1>

  <!-- Paragraphs with inline CSS: border + black font color -->
  <p style="color: black;   padding:12px;    margin-bottom:12px;">
    The term Scrum was first introduced by Jeff Sutherland and Ken Schwaber in 1995.
  </p>

  <p style="color: black;    padding:12px;     margin-bottom:12px;">
    Scrum takes the values and the principles defined in the Agile Manifesto and distills them into a simple to follow framework.
  </p>

  <p style="color: black;  padding:12px;     margin-bottom:12px;">
    Scrum provides general guidance for managing complex product development, but it does not define detailed actions.
  </p>

  <p style="color: black;   padding:12px;     margin-bottom:12px;">
    Instead, it focuses on a team-driven, empirical process.
  </p>

  <!-- Subheading - keep default color -->
  <h2 style="margin-top:18px; margin-bottom:12px; font-size:20px;">How does this look in practice?</h2>

  <p style="color: black;   padding:12px;     margin-bottom:12px;">
    Let's say you are working on a new product.
  </p>

  <p style="color: black;  ; padding:12px;     margin-bottom:12px;">
    The first step is to come up with an idea for the product. This can be done by talking to potential customers, doing market research, or simply coming up with a good idea on your own.
  </p>

  <p style="color: black;   padding:12px;     margin-bottom:12px;">
    The next step is to define what the product should do. This is called the product backlog, which is a list of all the features and functionality that need to be included in the product.
  </p>

  <p style="color: black;   padding:12px;     margin-bottom:12px;">
    The product backlog is maintained and prioritized by the product owner who's responsible for ensuring that the product meets the needs of the customer.
  </p>

  <!-- Subheading -->
  <h2 style="margin-top:18px; margin-bottom:12px; font-size:20px;">Roles in Scrum</h2>

  <p style="color: black;   padding:12px;     margin-bottom:12px;">
    In addition to the product owner, there are two other key roles in Scrum: Development Team and the Scrum Master.
  </p>

  <p style="color: black;   padding:12px;     margin-bottom:12px;">
    The development team is responsible for building the product. They have all the skills needed to build a working product, including analysis and design.
  </p>

  <p style="color: black;   padding:12px;    margin-bottom:12px;">
    The Scrum Master helps the team apply Scrum and follow its processes. The Scrum master makes sure that the team has all it needs to be as productive as possible.
  </p>

  <!-- Subheading -->
  <h2 style="margin-top:18px; margin-bottom:12px; font-size:20px;">Working with Sprints</h2>

  <p style="color: black;   padding:12px;     margin-bottom:12px;">
    Now let's talk about how work is organized in Scrum. Scrum uses fine grained timeboxes called sprints. Sprint is a fixed amount of time, typically 2 to 4 weeks long during which specific work is done.
  </p>

  <p style="color: black;  padding:12px;     margin-bottom:12px;">
    Before the start of each sprint, there is a planning meeting where the product owner and the development team members decide which product backlog items to select for the given sprint.
  </p>

  <p style="color: black;   padding:12px;     margin-bottom:12px;">
    The development team analyzes the high level items and converts them into a detailed list of tasks. The selected product backlog items and the detailed task list get merged into the Sprint backlog document.
  </p>

  <p style="color: black;   padding:12px;     margin-bottom:12px;">
    The development team is responsible for implementing these tasks and delivering the corresponding functionality. Each team member picks a task from the Sprint backlog and starts working on it.
  </p>

  <p style="color: black;   padding:12px;    margin-bottom:12px;">
    Development team members then meet each day to assess their progress. The Daily Scrum, also called Daily Stand Up, is a 15-minute meeting where the development team discusses what they've been working on and the obstacles that have surfaced and what is going to be worked on next.
  </p>

  <p style="color: black;   padding:12px;     margin-bottom:12px;">
    The Scrum master and the product owner work with the team to remove any roadblocks or impediments if the sprint is slipping behind. Tasks are re-estimated and reprioritized.
  </p>

  <p style="color: black;   padding:12px;     margin-bottom:12px;">
    Every sprint should result in a potentially shippable product increment, meaning that the product contains new features to show to customers at the end of each sprint.
  </p>

  <p style="color: black;   padding:12px;     margin-bottom:12px;">
    There is a sprint review meeting for the development team to showcase what they have built. This usually happens in the form of a product demo. The customers and other stakeholders get a chance to check out the new features and provide their feedback.
  </p>

  <p style="color: black;   padding:12px;     margin-bottom:12px;">
    The Sprint review meeting is followed by a retrospective meeting that goes over what was done during the sprint and what could be improved. This meeting is not about finger pointing, but instead about identifying issues and coming up with constructive solutions.
  </p>

  <p style="color: black;   padding:12px;   background:#ffffff; margin-bottom:12px;">
    Then the process starts over again until the project completes.
  </p>
 </div>
 

<div style="border:2px solid #000; border-radius:8px; padding:18px; max-width:900px; margin:24px auto; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height:1.6;">
  <h1>Sprint planning</h1>

  <p style="color:black; border:1px solid #ddd; padding:10px; border-radius:6px; margin-bottom:12px;">
    Sprint planning is where the development team, including the product owner, discusses the prioritized
    backlog of work known as product backlog items and decides which ones to complete in the upcoming sprint.
  </p>

  <p style="color:black; border:1px solid #ddd; padding:10px; border-radius:6px; margin-bottom:12px;">
    Each product backlog item is written as a user story, which helps to clearly communicate the desired
    functionality from the customer's perspective.
  </p>

  <p style="color:black; border:1px solid #ddd; padding:10px; border-radius:6px; margin-bottom:12px;">
    For example, a user story may be: <em>"As a customer, I want to be able to track my order so that I know
    when it will arrive."</em>
  </p>

  <p style="color:black; border:1px solid #ddd; padding:10px; border-radius:6px; margin-bottom:12px;">
    While anyone on the Scrum team can write user stories, the product owner typically gathers input from
    stakeholders, analyzes customers' needs and prioritizes user stories for maximum impact.
  </p>

  <p style="color:black; border:1px solid #ddd; padding:10px; border-radius:6px; margin-bottom:12px;">
    Effective user stories result in a clear understanding of project goals and help Scrum teams stay focused
    on delivering value to end users.
  </p>

  <h2>User story template</h2>

  <p style="color:black; border:1px solid #ddd; padding:10px; border-radius:6px; margin-bottom:12px;">
    A user story would follow this template: <strong>"As a &lt;type of user&gt;, I want to &lt;desired action&gt; so
    that &lt;benefit&gt;."</strong>
  </p>

  <p style="color:black; border:1px solid #ddd; padding:10px; border-radius:6px; margin-bottom:12px;">
    Now for the 'type of user' part, be specific. Instead of just saying "a user," try to identify a particular
    type such as a student or a marketing manager, because it really helps the team understand who they are
    building for and why.
  </p>

  <h2>Bad vs better example</h2>

  <p style="color:black; border:1px solid #ddd; padding:10px; border-radius:6px; margin-bottom:12px;">
    To illustrate my point, here's a bad user story:
  </p>

  <p style="color:black; border:1px solid #f5c6cb; padding:10px; border-radius:6px; margin-bottom:12px;">
    <em>"As a user, I want to see ads so that the company can make money."</em>
  </p>

  <p style="color:black; border:1px solid #ddd; padding:10px; border-radius:6px; margin-bottom:12px;">
    That doesn't sound very natural or user focused.
  </p>

  <p style="color:black; border:1px solid #ddd; padding:10px; border-radius:6px; margin-bottom:12px;">
    Instead, try something like:
  </p>

  <p style="color:black; border:1px solid #d4edda; padding:10px; border-radius:6px; margin-bottom:12px;">
    <em>"As a marketing manager, I want to see targeted ads on the website so that we can increase conversions
    and drive revenue."</em>
  </p>

  <p style="color:black; border:1px solid #ddd; padding:10px; border-radius:6px; margin-bottom:12px;">
    Much better, right? With a bit of refinement, the user story became clearer and more impactful, and it also
    sounds more natural.
  </p>

  <h2>Tips</h2>

  <ul style="list-style:disc inside; padding-left:0; color:black; border:1px solid #ddd; padding:10px; border-radius:6px; margin-bottom:12px;">
    <li style="color:black; margin:6px 0;">Keep them concise and focused on the end user's needs.</li>
    <li style="color:black; margin:6px 0;">Be specific about the user type.</li>
    <li style="color:black; margin:6px 0;">Describe the benefit clearly.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Back to Sprint planning</h2>

  <p style="color:black; border:1px solid #ddd; padding:10px; border-radius:6px; margin-bottom:12px;">
    Once the Scrum team commits to completing a set of user stories during the sprint, they break them
    down into tasks and estimate each one's level of effort, often measured in story points.
  </p>

  <p style="color:black; border:1px solid #ddd; padding:10px; border-radius:6px; margin-bottom:12px;">
    Note that story points are not a direct representation of time. Instead, they are used to help estimate the
    amount of effort required to complete the user story.
  </p>

  <p style="color:black; border:1px solid #ddd; padding:10px; border-radius:6px; margin-bottom:12px;">
    A story point value of 40 may not mean 40 hours worth of work — it depends on the agreement and understanding
    within the Scrum team.
  </p>

  <p style="color:black; border:1px solid #ddd; padding:10px; border-radius:6px; margin-bottom:12px;">
    For instance, it may represent a task that the Scrum team agrees is about as difficult as any other task they've
    completed in past sprints that had a story point value of 40.
  </p>

  <h2>Converting story points to time</h2>

  <p style="color:black; border:1px solid #ddd; padding:10px; border-radius:6px; margin-bottom:12px;">
    How do you convert story points to time? That's up to the Scrum team to decide.
  </p>

  <p style="color:black; border:1px solid #ddd; padding:10px; border-radius:6px; margin-bottom:12px;">
    Our team used an estimation strategy called <strong>Planning Poker</strong>, where Scrum team members held up
    cards with numbers representing their estimate in hours for a story's level of effort.
  </p>

  <pre style="color:black; border:1px solid #ddd; padding:10px; border-radius:6px; overflow:auto; background:#fff;">
Planning Poker example card values: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40
  </pre>

  <h1 style="margin:0 0 12px 0;color:#1a73e8;">Daily Standup (Daily Scrum)</h1>

  <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">
    The Daily Standup, also known as Daily Scrum, is a short, usually 15-minute long meeting where the
    development team members meet to discuss the progress of the current sprint.
  </p>

  <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">
    During the Daily Standup, each team member answers three questions:
  </p>
  <ol style="margin:0 0 16px 18px;padding:0;">
    <li style="margin:6px 0;">What did you do yesterday?</li>
    <li style="margin:6px 0;">What will you do today?</li>
    <li style="margin:6px 0;">Are there any blockers to report?</li>
  </ol>

  <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">
    These are the only questions that should be answered. If there are other questions that need to be discussed,
    then they should be saved for another time. The Daily Standup is not the time for long, drawn-out discussions.
    The goal is to keep the meeting focused on progress and blockers.
  </p>

  <h2 style="margin:18px 0 8px 0;color:#1a73e8;">Example Update</h2>
  <ul style="margin:0 0 12px 18px;padding:0;">
    <li style="margin:6px 0;">Yesterday I worked on the login page.</li>
    <li style="margin:6px 0;">I almost finished the frontend code, but I need to do some testing before it's done.</li>
    <li style="margin:6px 0;">Today I'm going to finish the login page and start working on the signup page.</li>
    <li style="margin:6px 0;">The only impediment is that I'm waiting on the design for the signup page.</li>
    <li style="margin:6px 0;">I'll follow up with the designer today.</li>
  </ul>

  <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">
    You can clearly identify what was done yesterday, what needs to be done today and any blockers. The Daily Standup
    is not a time for solving problems. If there's an impediment, then it should be noted and someone should be assigned
    to follow up on it. But the actual problem solving should happen after the standup.
  </p>

  <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">
    The Daily Standup is a great way to keep the team focused and on track. It's also a good way to identify any problems
    early on so that they can be addressed quickly.
  </p>

  <h2 style="margin:18px 0 8px 0;color:#1a73e8;">Psychological Tricks to Keep It Short & Effective</h2>

  <h3 style="margin:14px 0 6px 0;color:#1a73e8;">Have everyone stand up</h3>
  <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">
    It's helpful to have everyone stand up during the meeting. After all, it's called a standup for a reason.
    Standing up has been shown to improve focus and keep meetings shorter.
  </p>

  <h3 style="margin:14px 0 6px 0;color:#1a73e8;">The Scrum Ball</h3>
  <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">
    Use a “scrum ball” (any safe object) passed around during the meeting. Whoever holds the ball is the only one who can talk.
    After answering the three questions, they pass the ball randomly to someone else. The randomness increases attention because
    people don’t know when they’ll be called on.
  </p>

  <h3 style="margin:14px 0 6px 0;color:#1a73e8;">Keep it short</h3>
  <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">
    To avoid getting sidetracked, keep answers short and to the point. For fun accountability, we had a rule:
    if anyone went way over their time limit, they had to buy the whole team ice cream. Silly—but effective.
  </p>

  <h3 style="margin:14px 0 6px 0;color:#1a73e8;">Same place, same time</h3>
  <p style="margin:0 0 0 0;">
    It’s crucial to have the standup at the same time and place every day. If the meeting keeps moving or getting rescheduled,
    people get frustrated, some will be late, and the meeting becomes less effective.
  </p>
</div>


<div style="max-width:900px;margin:20px auto;border:2px solid #222;border-radius:12px;padding:24px;background:#fff;font-family:system-ui,-apple-system,Segoe UI,Roboto,Arial,sans-serif;line-height:1.6;color:#000;">
  <h1 style="margin:0 0 12px 0;color:#1a73e8;">Sprint Review </h1>

  <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">
    Keep Slides Minimal, Focus on the Demo Slides are often used as a crutch and they tend to make sprint reviews longer and more boring.
  </p>
  <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">
    If you absolutely must use slides, then keep them to a minimum. Focusing on the actual work instead
    of boring everyone to death with a slide deck is a much better use of everyone's time.
  </p>

  <blockquote style="margin:0 0 16px 0;padding:10px 14px;border-left:4px solid #1a73e8;background:#f7f9fc;color:#000;">
    This reminds me of the following quote by Steve Jobs:<br>
    “People who know what they are talking about don't need PowerPoint.”
  </blockquote>

  <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">
    So try to briefly summarize the achievements of the sprint and move on to the demo.
  </p>

  <h2 style="margin:18px 0 8px 0;color:#1a73e8;">Make the Demo the Star</h2>
  <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">
    The demo is where things get interesting. Technical demos, when presented well, can be really exciting and engaging.
    They can also be a great way to get feedback from the product owner and stakeholders, but all too often they are dry and boring.
  </p>

  <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">
      participated in   sprint review meetings,     When done right, they can be a great way
    to get everyone on the same page and collect feedback. But when done wrong, they can be a complete disaster.
  </p>

  <h1 style="margin:0 0 12px 0;color:#1a73e8;">Sprint Retrospective</h1>

  <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">
    The Sprint retrospective is a meeting that's held at the end of every sprint. It's an opportunity for the team to reflect on the past sprint. 
    The goal is to identify what went well, what could be improved and what actions should be taken to make improvements in the future.
  </p>

  <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">
    The Scrum master facilitates the meeting and all members of the development team should participate. 
    Neither product owners nor stakeholders should attend the retrospective, as it's meant to be a safe space for the team to openly share their thoughts and ideas.
  </p>

  <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">
    I'm not sure whether the retrospective or the daily standup felt more awkward when I first started out with Scrum, but I can tell you that over time 
    the retrospective has become one of my favorite meetings.
  </p>

  <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">
    I wouldn't even call it a meeting anymore, but more of a chance for the team to get together and have an open, honest conversation about what's working and what's not. 
    It's a chance to come up with creative solutions to problems, and it's a chance to build trust and collaboration within the team.
  </p>

  <h2 style="margin:18px 0 8px 0;color:#1a73e8;">How to Run a Sprint Retrospective</h2>
  <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">
    Let's say you just completed a sprint. The Sprint review went relatively well, but there were a few hiccups here and there. 
    The team couldn't quite meet the sprint goal and there were a couple of bugs that interfered with the demo.
  </p>
  <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">
    In addition, one of the stakeholders asked a tough question that the team was not prepared to answer at the beginning of the retrospective. 
    Everyone has a chance to share their thoughts on the past sprint. This can be done in a variety of ways, such as through a round-robin discussion or brainstorming.
  </p>

  <h3 style="margin:14px 0 6px 0;color:#1a73e8;">Start with What Went Well</h3>
  <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">
    First, we went around the room and each person shared one thing that they thought went well in the past sprint.
    For instance, I thought the team did a great job of communicating with each other. 
    I was really happy with how we handled the unexpected bug before the demo.
  </p>
  <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">
    It's crucial to start the retrospective on a positive note. This sets the tone for the rest of the meeting and allows everyone to share their thoughts openly. 
    The speaker should be brief, 1 to 2 minutes at most and should avoid getting into too much detail. Interruptions are not allowed at this stage.
  </p>
  <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">
    The Scrum master or another designated team member should take notes during this part of the retrospective so that all ideas are captured. 
    We usually use the whiteboard for this, or sometimes a text editor that was shared using a projector.
  </p>
  <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">
    <b>Bottom line:</b> Make sure everyone can see the ideas that are being generated.
  </p>

  <h3 style="margin:14px 0 6px 0;color:#1a73e8;">Discuss Improvements</h3>
  <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">
    After everyone has had a chance to share their thoughts on what went well, it's time to move on to the next topic: <b>What could be improved?</b>  
    Just like before, each person takes a turn sharing their thoughts.
  </p>
  <ul style="margin:0 0 12px 18px;padding:0;">
    <li style="margin:6px 0;">I think we could have done a better job of estimating tasks that involve research.</li>
    <li style="margin:6px 0;">We need to improve our network layer to prevent sporadic bugs like the ones we saw during the demo.</li>
  </ul>

  <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">
    These ideas should be captured in the same way as the positive ones. Again, the speaker should be brief and to the point.
  </p>

  <h3 style="margin:14px 0 6px 0;color:#1a73e8;">Brainstorm Actions</h3>
  <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">
    After that, we brainstormed potential actions that we could take to improve the situation:
  </p>
  <ul style="margin:0 0 12px 18px;padding:0;">
    <li style="margin:6px 0;">Before each review, test-run the demo while Zoom is open to catch glitches early.</li>
    <li style="margin:6px 0;">Set aside time for research when estimating tasks.</li>
    <li style="margin:6px 0;">Improve network layer’s unit test coverage to catch bugs before production.</li>
  </ul>

  <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">
    Finally, the team decides on the top few actions they want to focus on for the next sprint. 
    This helps the team focus on a few key areas rather than trying to tackle everything at once. 
    These items are then added to the next sprint’s backlog.
  </p>

  <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">
    What happens with the rest of the ideas that were generated? They are added to a <b>parking lot</b>, which is essentially a list of potential improvements that the team can come back to later.
  </p>

  <h3 style="margin:14px 0 6px 0;color:#1a73e8;">Conclusion</h3>
  <p style="margin:0 0 0 0;">
    So that's how we've been running our retrospectives. This simple process has helped us improve our sprints and learn from our mistakes. 
    I hope it does the same for you.

    <!-- Title (Heading text left unchanged w.r.t color) -->
    <h1 style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:16px; font-size:28px;">Kanban Overview</h1>

    <!-- Intro Card -->
    <div style="   padding:16px; margin-bottom:16px;">
      <p style="color:#000; line-height:1.6; margin:0 0 10px 0;">
        Kanban will probably sound familiar to you if you've ever used a task management tool like Trello, Asana or any other board-based system. That's because Kanban is all about visualizing your work so that you can see what needs to be done and when.
      </p>
      <p style="color:#000; line-height:1.6; margin:0;">
        The word <em>Kanban</em> means signboard or billboard in Japanese.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- History Card -->
    <div style="   padding:16px; margin-bottom:16px;">
      <h2 style="margin:0 0 12px 0; font-size:22px;">Origins</h2>
      <p style="color:#000; line-height:1.6; margin:0 0 10px 0;">
        This visual management system was created in 1940 by Taiichi Ohno, an industrial engineer at Toyota Motor Corporation, to increase the efficiency of the company's manufacturing processes.
      </p>
      <p style="color:#000; line-height:1.6; margin:0;">
        The basic idea behind Kanban is to make the workflow visible so that bottlenecks and inefficiencies can be identified and addressed.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Kanban Cards / Pull vs Push -->
    <div style= " padding:16px; margin-bottom:16px;">
      <h2 style="margin:0 0 12px 0; font-size:22px;">Kanban Cards & Pull System</h2>
      <p style="color:#000; line-height:1.6; margin:0 0 10px 0;">
        If inventory levels for a particular part fall below a specified threshold, a Kanban card is used to signal the need to produce more of that part. The Kanban card is basically a message from the consumer to the supplier that more parts are needed.
      </p>
      <p style="color:#000; line-height:1.6; margin:0;">
        Unlike the push-based system of traditional assembly lines—meaning that parts are produced even if there is no demand for them—Kanban is a pull-based system, which means that parts are produced based on actual demand.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Benefits Card -->
    <div style="   padding:16px; margin-bottom:16px;">
      <h2 style="margin:0 0 12px 0; font-size:22px;">Why It Works</h2>
      <p style="color:#000; line-height:1.6; margin:0;">
        This approach eliminates overproduction and optimizes inventory levels, which leads to cost savings and increased efficiency.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Software Adaptation Card -->
    <div style="  padding:16px; margin-bottom:16px;">
      <h2 style="margin:0 0 12px 0; font-size:22px;">From Factory to Software</h2>
      <p style="color:#000; line-height:1.6; margin:0 0 10px 0;">
        In the early 2000s, a software engineer named David Anderson began adapting the Kanban manufacturing process for software development. His efforts led to the creation of the Kanban method, which is now used by software development teams all over the world.
      </p>
      <p style="color:#000; line-height:1.6; margin:0;">
        Kanban is a flexible system that can be adapted to fit the needs of any organization.
      </p>

      <ol style="color:#000; margin:0; padding-left:18px; line-height:1.6;">
        <li style="margin-bottom:10px;">
          <strong>Visualizing the work:</strong>
          <span style="color:#000;">Create a visual representation of your work, such as a Kanban board.</span>
        </li>
        <li style="margin-bottom:10px;">
          <strong>Limiting work in progress (WIP):</strong>
          <span style="color:#000;">Set limits on the number of tasks that can be in progress at any given time to avoid bottlenecks and ensure timely completion.</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Improving continuously:</strong>
          <span style="color:#000;">Constantly evaluate and improve the way you work to identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies and find ways to eliminate them.</span>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <!-- Footer Note -->
    <div style="   padding:12px; margin-top:16px; background:#fcfcfc;">
      <p style="color:#000; line-height:1.6; margin:0;">
        Tip: Start with a simple board (To&nbsp;Do → In&nbsp;Progress → Done) and gradually add WIP limits as your team gets comfortable.
      </p>
    </div>

<div style="border:2px solid #000; border-radius:8px; padding:18px; max-width:900px; margin:24px auto; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height:1.6;">
    <h1>Kanban board </h1>

    <p style="color:black;   padding:10px;  ">
      The idea behind Kanban is pretty simple.
    </p>

    <p style="color:black;   padding:10px;  ">
      You have a board with columns representing the different stages of your workflow and cards depicting
      the tasks that need to be completed.
    </p>

    <p style="color:black;   padding:10px;  ">
      In a typical setup you might have columns for "Todo," "In progress" and "Done."
    </p>

    <p style="color:black;   padding:10px;  ">
      Each developer is assigned a task which they move from one stage to the next as they make progress.
    </p>

    <h2>Example Workflow</h2>

    <p style="color:black;   padding:10px;  ">
      Let's say you start working on a task. Initially it would be in the Todo column. Once you start working on it, move it to the "In progress" column. When you're finished, move it to the "Done" column. It's that simple.
    </p>

    <p style="color:black;   padding:10px;  ">
      Imagine how valuable this simplicity can be when you have a team of developers working on a project
      with dozens or even hundreds of tasks. Kanban makes it easy to see what needs to be done, track the progress of each task and help identify and address bottlenecks in the workflow.
    </p>

    <p style="color:black;   padding:10px;  ">
      It's also worth noting that Kanban boards can be as straightforward or as complex as you need them to
      be. For instance, you might add additional columns for different stages of work, such as "In review," "QA" or "Deploy." The point is that the Kanban system is flexible and you can customize it to fit the needs of your team.
    </p>

    <h2>Scaling Kanban</h2>

    <p style="color:black;   padding:10px;  ">
      Say you're working on a project with a large team. You can create Kanban boards for each developer or workflow stage.
      You might have one board for the frontend and another for the backend development tasks.
      Or you might create one board for the design tasks and another for the coding tasks.
      The possibilities are endless.
    </p>

    <p style="color:black;   padding:10px;  ">
      The important thing is that Kanban can be adapted to fit the needs of almost any organization or project,
      no matter how big or small.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Kanban Works</h2>

    <p style="color:black;   padding:10px;  ">
      I love that Kanban is a simple system that can be used to great effect. It's easy to learn and implement but also extremely powerful.
    </p>

     
    <p style="color:black;   padding:10px;   ">
        I've been a huge advocate of Kanban. It is used   on countless projects and it never fails to impress  developers  If you're looking for a way to increase your team's productivity, I highly recommend giving Kanban a try.
    </p>

    <h2>Next</h2>

    <p style="color:black;   padding:10px;  ">
      We'll look at how to set up a Kanban board using Asana.
    </p>

  </div>


<div style="border:2px solid #000; border-radius:8px; padding:18px; max-width:900px; margin:24px auto; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height:1.6;">
  <h1>How to set up a Kanban board using Asana</h1>

  <p style="color: black;   padding: 10px;  ">  we're going to take a look at how to set up a Kanban board using Asana.</p>

  <p style="color: black;   padding: 10px; ">If you're unfamiliar with Asana, it's a web-based project management tool incredibly popular with Agile teams.</p>

  <p style="color: black;   padding: 10px;  ">To get started, go to asana.com and create an account. The registration process is quick and easy and you should be up and running in no time.</p>

  <p style="color: black;   padding: 10px;  ">Once you're logged in, create a new project. I'll go ahead and call this one 'Kanban Demo.'</p>

  <p style="color: black;   padding: 10px;  ">Next, choose 'Board' as the default view type and hit continue.</p>

  <p style="color: black;   padding: 10px;  ;">At this point you can start adding team members to your project, but for now we'll just add tasks. So leave the default 'Start adding tasks' selection, and click the 'Go to project' button.</p>

  <p style="color: black;   padding: 10px;  ">As you can see, Asana has automatically created a few columns for us: 'To do,' 'In progress,' and 'Complete.' These are the default columns, but you can rename or delete them.</p>

  <p style="color: black;   padding: 10px;  ">If you need additional columns, just click the 'Add section' button on the right side of the screen. For this demo, we'll stick with the default columns.</p>

  <p style="color: black;   padding: 10px;  ">Now let's create the first tasks. I'll go ahead and add a task called 'Create Kanban board' in the 'To do' column.</p>

  <p style="color: black;   padding: 10px;  ">There are a few different ways to create the first task. You can rename the task that was automatically created for you. Add a task by clicking the 'Add task button' or by clicking the plus sign next to the 'To do' column.</p>

  <p style="color: black;   padding: 10px;  ">I'll edit task one by clicking on the task and changing the name to 'Create Kanban board.' Asana lets you set the assignee--the person responsible for completing the task--as well as the due date and the description.</p>

  <p style="color: black;   padding: 10px;  ">You can create subtasks in case the task is too big to be completed in one go, and you can also add attachments and perform other actions. When you're done, hit the Esc button or just click outside the task to save your changes.</p>

  <p style="color: black;  padding: 10px;  ">Now let's create a couple more tasks. I'll add a task called 'Add tasks to Kanban board' and another one called 'Demonstrate how Kanban Board Works.'</p>

  <p style="color: black;   padding: 10px;  ">To move a task to a different column, click and drag it to the desired location. You can also click on the task and change the column type in the detail view by clicking on the drop-down menu.</p>

  <p style="color: black; padding: 10px;  ">We have already completed the first task 'Create Kanban board,' so I'll move it to the 'Complete' column using the drag-and-drop method.</p>

  <p style="color: black;   padding: 10px;  ">We are in the process of adding tasks to the Kanban board, so I'll move that task to the 'In progress' column.</p>

  <p style="color: black;   padding: 10px;  ">How about the 'Demonstrate how Kanban Board Works' task? Well, that one is in progress because we're currently working on it.</p>

  <p style="color: black;   padding: 10px;  ">As you can see, setting up a Kanban board in Asana is a breeze.</p>

  <p style="color: black;  padding: 10px;  ">Other web-based Kanban tools are also available, such as Trello and Jira. You can use a physical Kanban board, which works great if your team is based in the same location. However, a web-based tool is probably the best option for remote teams.</p>

  <h2 style="color: darkblue;      padding: 10px;">
    Programming   Introduction
  </h2>

  <p style="color: black;    padding: 8px;">
    We're going to delve into programming.
  </p>

  <p style="color: black;   padding: 8px;">
    We start with the basics and gradually build up the knowledge required to understand more advanced programming concepts.
  </p>

  <p style="color: black;   padding: 8px;">
      I'll be using Python code examples.
  </p>

  <p style="color: black;    padding: 8px;">
    These examples are straightforward, and I explain everything thoroughly. Entering the code and running it yourself is the most efficient way to learn the presented concepts.
  </p>

  <p style="color: black;   padding: 8px;">
    You may make some mistakes as you type the code, but don't worry! The more you practice coding, the easier it becomes.
  </p>

  <p style="color: black;   padding: 8px;">
    And let me share a little secret with you: even seasoned developers make mistakes. To err is human, but to really foul things up you need a computer.
  </p>

  <p style="color: black;   padding: 8px;">
    All right, let's dig in!
  </p>

</div>


<div style="border:2px solid #000; border-radius:8px; padding:18px; max-width:900px; margin:24px auto; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height:1.6;">

  <!-- Heading: keep default color (no inline color set) -->
  <h1 style="margin-bottom:18px;">Introduction to Programming</h1>

  <!-- Container with border (inline CSS) -->
   
    <p style="color:black; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;  padding:12px;  ">
      Coding or programming is telling a computer what to do.
    </p>

    <p style="color:black; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;   padding:12px;  ">
      It works by typing commands in a specific order.
    </p>

    <p style="color:black; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;   padding:12px;  ">
      Every computer program consists of sequences of commands. Your mail app, the web browser, Facebook, WhatsApp, the games on your phone — each of them is a set of instructions.
    </p>

    <p style="color:black; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px; padding:12px;  ">
      These instructions tell the computer to perform specific tasks, like multiplying two numbers, opening a file or making your computer beep.
    </p>

    <p style="color:black; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;   padding:12px;  ">
      Some programs consist of only a few instructions, while more complex ones may contain hundreds of thousands or even millions of instructions.
    </p>

    <p style="color:black; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;   padding:12px;  ">
      To understand how programming works, let's imagine that you want to cook an omelet. You've never cooked before, so what do you do?
    </p>

    <p style="color:black; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;  padding:12px;  ">
      You start by searching for "how to cook an omelet" on the Internet.
    </p>

    <p style="color:black; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;  padding:12px;  ">
      Then, you pick a website or a video that provides step by step instructions for cooking your meal.
    </p>

    <p style="color:black; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;   padding:12px;  ">
      That's precisely how computer programs work. Programmers break down complex tasks into simple, individual steps. The order of these steps is critical.
    </p>

    <p style="color:black; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;   padding:12px;  ">
      Just like in the case of a recipe, you'll get completely different results if you mix up the instructions. Let's assume that we can use the following instructions to navigate on a map: <strong>Move Forward</strong>, <strong>Turn Left</strong>, and <strong>Turn Right</strong>.
    </p>

    <p style="color:black; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;   padding:12px;  ">
      Next, we built two sequences using these commands. First sequence: <em>Move Forward, Turn Left, Move Forward, Turn Right, Move Forward.</em>
    </p>

    <p style="color:black; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;   padding:12px;  ">
      Second sequence: <em>Turn Right, Move Forward, Move Forward, Turn Left, Move Forward.</em> As you can see, the order of commands does indeed make a huge difference.
    </p>

    <p style="color:black; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;   padding:12px;  ">
      The computer does what you tell it to do, even if the instructions do not make sense. For example, you could create the following sequence of commands, and the machine would blindly execute them: <em>Move Forward, Move Forward, Move Forward.</em>
    </p>

    <p style="color:black; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:12px;  padding:12px;  ">
      Programming mistakes may cause crashes, data corruption, performance issues, or even hardware failures.
    </p>

    <p style="color:black; line-height:1.6; margin-bottom:0;   padding:12px;  ">
      A programmer needs to know what instructions to use to achieve a particular functionality, what are the implications of using specific features or resources and how to detect and fix software bugs.
    </p>

  </div>


<div style="border:2px solid #000; border-radius:8px; padding:18px; max-width:900px; margin:24px auto; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height:1.6;"> 

   <h1 style="margin-top:0; color:#2a7ae2;"> programming languages    </h1>

    <p style="color: black; margin: 12px 0; line-height: 1.6;"> >By now you've probably got an idea of what programming is: giving directions to computers in the form
of sequences of instructions.We provide these instructions using programming languages.</p>

    <p style="color: black; margin: 12px 0; line-height: 1.6;">When we say programming language, we usually refer to high-level programming languages like Python, Swift,

C++, Java, or C#. Each programming language consists of a set of keywords and some rules for instructing

the computer what to do.</p>

    <p style="color: black; margin: 12px 0; line-height: 1.6;">It's like the vocabulary and the grammatical rules

in the case of human languages.  </p>

      
    <p style="color: black; margin: 12px 0; line-height: 1.6;">  we can use two completely different programming languages to implement

the same functionality.</p>

    <p style="color: black; margin: 12px 0; line-height: 1.6;">How is that even possible?</p>

    <p style="color: black; margin: 12px 0; line-height: 1.6;">Does the computer understand so many programming languages?</p>

    <p style="color: black; margin: 12px 0; line-height: 1.6;">The short answer is No.</p>

    <p style="color: black; margin: 12px 0; line-height: 1.6;">The computer, or rather its CPU - the central processing unit - can only execute machine language instructions.</p>

    <p style="color: black; margin: 12px 0; line-height: 1.6;">The machine code isn't something you want to use to write programs.</p>

    <p style="color: black; margin: 12px 0; line-height: 1.6;">You'd need to enter numbers instead of humanly readable instructions.</p>

    <p style="color: black; margin: 12px 0; line-height: 1.6;">Forget statements like "print" or "format," because the CPU only understand numbers.</p>

    <p style="color: black; margin: 12px 0; line-height: 1.6;">Besides, the machine code is hardware specific: machine language instructions that work on a CPU

won't work on another model.</p>

    <p style="color: black; margin: 12px 0; line-height: 1.6;">Therefore, we need to use machine instructions that can be understood by each hardware we're targeting.</p>

    <p style="color: black; margin: 12px 0; line-height: 1.6;">Scary, right? But no worries!</p>

    <p style="color: black; margin: 12px 0; line-height: 1.6;">That's why high-level programming languages exist. When we execute our high-level code,

it goes through a series of transformations, and eventually, the machine code gets generated.</p>

    <p style="color: black; margin: 12px 0; line-height: 1.6;">At this point, our program can run on the computer.</p>

    <p style="color: black; margin: 12px 0; line-height: 1.6;">Nowadays, developers don't need to look into machine code. Just make sure that your code makes sense, and

it has no flaws.</p>

    <p style="color: black; margin: 12px 0 0 0; line-height: 1.6;">The rest is taken care of by smart developer tools.</p>

<h2 style="color:darkblue;">    Python.  </h2>

<p style="color:black;   padding:8px;">
I decided to use Python. Here's why. Python is easy to pick up, and you can learn the basics of programming quickly.
</p>

<p style="color:black;   padding:8px;">
Python is one of the easiest programming languages out there.
</p>

<p style="color:black;   padding:8px;">
Python is a high-level programming language that has gained massive popularity among data scientists, AI and machine learning researchers who want to get their job done quickly.
</p>

<p style="color:  padding:8px;">
I'm confident that Python will fast track your journey into the world of programming.

      <h1 style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:12px; font-size:32px; line-height:1.25; color:#0B5ED7;">Setting up Python on your computer</h1>
      <p style="color:#000; font-size:16px; line-height:1.7; margin:0 0 14px;">Let us begin by checking if Python 3 is installed and properly configured on your computer.</p>
      
      <h2 style="margin:20px 0 8px; font-size:24px; line-height:1.35; color:#0B5ED7;">Why Python&nbsp;3</h2>
      <p style="color:#000; font-size:16px; line-height:1.7; margin:0 0 14px;">I'll be using Python&nbsp;3 in this course, so I recommend you install it, too. If you're using macOS or Linux, you've probably got Python already installed on your system.</p>
      
      <h2 style="margin:20px 0 8px; font-size:24px; line-height:1.35; color:#0B5ED7;">Check if Python 3 is installed</h2>
      <p style="color:#000; font-size:16px; line-height:1.7; margin:0 0 10px;">Open a terminal window:</p>
      <ul style="color:#000; margin:0 0 14px 18px; padding:0; font-size:16px; line-height:1.7;">
        <li style="margin:6px 0;">On Windows, start <span style="font-weight:600; color:#000;">cmd</span>.</li>
        <li style="margin:6px 0;">On macOS or Linux, launch the <span style="font-weight:600; color:#000;">Terminal</span> app.</li>
      </ul>
      <p style="color:#000; font-size:16px; line-height:1.7; margin:0 0 10px;">Then type:</p>
      <pre style="white-space:pre-wrap; background:#fbfbfc; border:1px solid #222; border-radius:12px; padding:14px; font-size:15px; line-height:1.6; color:#000; overflow:auto; margin:0 0 14px;"><code>python3 --version</code></pre>
      <p style="color:#000; font-size:16px; line-height:1.7; margin:0 0 14px;">If that shows a version, you're good. If you get an error, try:</p>
      <pre style="white-space:pre-wrap; background:#fbfbfc; border:1px solid #222; border-radius:12px; padding:14px; font-size:15px; line-height:1.6; color:#000; overflow:auto; margin:0 0 14px;"><code>python --version</code></pre>
      <p style="color:#000; font-size:16px; line-height:1.7; margin:0 0 14px;">If you still see an error, Python is likely not installed.</p>

      <h2 style="margin:20px 0 8px; font-size:24px; line-height:1.35; color:#0B5ED7;">Note about Python&nbsp;2.7</h2>
      <p style="color:#000; font-size:16px; line-height:1.7; margin:0 0 14px;">On many Macs, Python&nbsp;2.7 (the older series) may still exist. It only receives critical fixes and is no longer actively developed. Prefer Python&nbsp;3.</p>

      <h2 style="margin:20px 0 8px; font-size:24px; line-height:1.35; color:#0B5ED7;">Install Python&nbsp;3</h2>
      <ol style="color:#000; margin:0 0 14px 18px; padding:0; font-size:16px; line-height:1.7;">
        <li style="margin:6px 0;">Visit <span style="font-weight:600; color:#000;">python.org</span> in your browser.</li>
        <li style="margin:6px 0;">Hover over <span style="font-weight:600; color:#000;">Downloads</span> and pick your platform if needed.</li>
        <li style="margin:6px 0;">Download the latest Python&nbsp;3 release.</li>
        <li style="margin:6px 0;">Run the installer and follow the prompts to complete installation.</li>
      </ol>
      <p style="color:#000; font-size:16px; line-height:1.7; margin:0 0 10px;">Verify the installation:</p>
      <pre style="white-space:pre-wrap; background:#fbfbfc; border:1px solid #222; border-radius:12px; padding:14px; font-size:15px; line-height:1.6; color:#000; overflow:auto; margin:0 0 14px;"><code>python3 --version</code></pre>

      <h2 style="margin:20px 0 8px; font-size:24px; line-height:1.35; color:#0B5ED7;">Next steps</h2>
      <p style="color:#000; font-size:16px; line-height:1.7; margin:0;">Next, we're going to install and configure our development environment.</p>
    </div>


<div style="border:2px solid #000; border-radius:8px; padding:18px; max-width:900px; margin:24px auto; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height:1.6;">

      <!-- Headings: no color style applied -->
      <h1 style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:12px;"> The Python Command Line</h1>

      <!-- Body text: explicit black color -->
      <p style="color:#000; margin:0 0 12px;">
        Now that you have Python 3 installed on your machine, let's try it out.
      </p>
      <p style="color:#000; margin:0 0 12px;">
        If you're on Windows, start the program called "cmd." On a Mac or a Linux system launch the "Terminal" program.
      </p>
      <p style="color:#000; margin:0 0 12px;">
        Next, type the following command in the terminal: "python3"
      </p>
      <p style="color:#000; margin:0 0 12px;">
        This command starts at the interactive Python language shell, also known as Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop, in short, REPL.
        A Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop, also termed an interactive top-level or language shell, is a simple, interactive computer
        programming environment that takes single user inputs – that is, single expressions –, evaluates them, and returns the
        result to the user. A program written in a REPL environment is executed piece wise. The Python shell executes the Python
        instructions we write. It reads the input entered by users, evaluates the code we typed, and prints the results so we
        can see the response. Then, it loops back to the first step.
      </p>

      <h2 style="margin-top:24px; margin-bottom:12px;">Basic math in the REPL</h2>

      <p style="color:#000; margin:0 0 12px;">
        Now, let's do some basic math. We can add two or more numbers. Let's try, for example, two plus two or two plus three plus five.
      </p>
      <p style="color:#000; margin:0 0 12px;">
        We can also subtract numbers: 120 minus 3.14. Or multiply them: 17 times six. Divide: 64 divided by 8 or 129 divided by 98.
        We can even raise a number to a power: 5 squared which should be 25 – right.
      </p>
      <p style="color:#000; margin:0 0 12px;">
        The Python shell can also evaluate multiple operations. Python follows the order of operations when evaluating math expressions.
        We can quit the shell any time by typing <code style="color:#000; background:#f2f2f2; padding:0 4px; border-radius:4px;">exit</code>.
        We'll talk about the parenthesis stuff later in the course.
      </p>

      <h2 style="margin-top:24px; margin-bottom:12px;">Back to the command line</h2>

      <p style="color:#000; margin:0 0 12px;">
        Now we're back to our command line. What if I'd like to go back and work a bit on my code? If I open a new REPL it will start
        everything from scratch. There is no way to go back and continue where we left off.
      </p>
      <p style="color:#000; margin:0 0 12px;">
        REPL can be used to try out simple snippets of code. However, it's not the right solution if we want to edit or reuse our code.
      </p>

  <h2 style="color: darkblue; text-align:center;">Setting up Visual Studio Code</h2>

  <p style="  padding: 10px; color: black;">
    We’ll be using Visual Studio Code. It’s a versatile IDE that’s available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. 
    You can download the latest stable version for free from 
    <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com" target="_blank" style="color: black;">https://code.visualstudio.com</a>.
  </p>

  <p style="   padding: 10px; color: black;">
    Visual Studio Code comes with a variety of useful plugins that will make our life easier when working with Python.
  </p>

  <p style="  padding: 10px; color: black;">
    After downloading VSCode, launch it and go to the Extensions panel. 
    You can do that by clicking the View menu and choosing Extensions, or by clicking the Extensions icon.
  </p>

  <p style="  padding: 10px; color: black;">
    In the Extensions panel, type “python” in the search box and install the one provided by Microsoft. 
    This plugin comes with Python syntax highlighting, but it also lets us run and debug Python code from within VSCode.
  </p>

  <p style="    padding: 10px; color: black;">
    Install the plugin and restart VSCode. Now, you’re ready to start coding in Visual Studio Code!

      Creating a Python Program that Reads User Input
    </h1>

    <p style="color:#000; font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, Segoe UI, Roboto, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height:1.6;    padding:12px;  ">
      Computers can perform all sorts of calculations blazingly fast, and output the results in some form, typically by displaying them on the screen. That wouldn't be very useful if we couldn't feed the computer with user data. In this section, we're going to create a program that waits for user input and produces the output based on what the user entered.
    </p>

    <p style="color:#000; font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, Segoe UI, Roboto, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height:1.6;   padding:12px;  ">
      Open up VSCode and create a new file by clicking <em>File</em> and select <em>New File</em>. A new file gets created with the name "Untitled-1." Save the file using <em>File &gt; Save As</em> and name it <strong>user-input.py</strong>. After saving the file, type in the following statement. It's important to type it as you see it: <strong>name</strong> in lowercase = <strong>input</strong> open parentheses, for text, <strong>"Type your name"</strong> between double quotes and close parenthesis.
    </p>

    <div style="border:1px solid #d1d5db; border-radius:8px; padding:12px; background:#f8fafc; margin:12px 0;">
      <pre style="margin:0; color:#000; font-size:15px; font-family:Consolas, Monaco, 'Courier New', monospace; white-space:pre;">
name = input("Type your name: ")
message = f"Hello, {name}!"
print(message)
      </pre>
    </div>

    <p style="color:#000; font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, Segoe UI, Roboto, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height:1.6;  padding:12px;  ">
      Now, what are we doing here? <code style="color:#000; background:#f3f4f6; padding:2px 6px; border:1px solid #e5e7eb; border-radius:6px;">input("prompt")</code> is a Python function. It prints the prompt string to the terminal and then waits until the user types something and hits Enter. The function returns what the user typed and stores it into a variable called <strong>name</strong>. A variable is a container that can store a value we want to use later in our program.
    </p>

    <p style="color:#000; font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, Segoe UI, Roboto, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height:1.6;   padding:12px;  ">
      So, the <strong>name</strong> variable stores the value returned by the <code style="color:#000; background:#f3f4f6; padding:2px 6px; border:1px solid #e5e7eb; border-radius:6px;">input()</code> function. We assign the value using the assignment operator. Next, type the following statement in a new line. Here we create a formatted string literal using f-Strings and assign it to the variable called <strong>message</strong>. The code <code style="color:#000; background:#f3f4f6; padding:2px 6px; border:1px solid #e5e7eb; border-radius:6px;">f"Hello, {name}!"</code> creates a formatted string by replacing the expressions between curly braces with their values. If <strong>name</strong> has the value "Michael." the result will be "Hello, Michael!".
    </p>

    <p style="color:#000; font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, Segoe UI, Roboto, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height:1.6;    padding:12px;  ">
      We're going to talk about strings and string manipulation in more depth later in this course. Now type the last statement. The <code style="color:#000; background:#f3f4f6; padding:2px 6px; border:1px solid #e5e7eb; border-radius:6px;">print()</code> function should be already familiar to you. It outputs the value of the <strong>message</strong> variable to the terminal.
    </p>

    <p style="color:#000; font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, Segoe UI, Roboto, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height:1.6;  padding:12px;  ">
      <strong>Summary:</strong> First, we prompt the user to enter a name. Once the user hits the Enter key, we store whatever they entered in a variable. Next, we create a new formatted string literal that greets the user. And finally, we print the text created at the previous step to the console.
    </p>

    <p style="color:#000; font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, Segoe UI, Roboto, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height:1.6;  padding:12px;  ">
      <strong>Run it:</strong> In VSCode, right click anywhere in your editor and select <em>Run Python File in Terminal</em>. Type a name (e.g., "Oscar") and press Enter. You should see the greeting printed back.

  <h1>Comments in Python</h1>

  <p style="  padding:12px; margin:10px 0;  color:black;  ">
    High-level programming languages have a human-friendly syntax.
  </p>

  <p style="  padding:12px; margin:10px 0;   color:black;  ">
    The code written in a high-level language is a way easier to read compared to the binary code.
  </p>

  <p style="  padding:12px; margin:10px 0;  color:black;  ">
    However, as your programs grow in complexity, it becomes harder to understand its logic without additional
    information.
  </p>

  <p style="  padding:12px; margin:10px 0;  color:black;  ">
    So far, we've implemented two short programs and I explained every statement.
  </p>

  <p style="  padding:12px; margin:10px 0;  color:black; ">
    This approach works for programming courses and books: you type in the code while following along with the instructor.
  </p>

  <p style="  padding:12px; margin:10px 0;  color:black;  ">
    That's usually not a feasible alternative when coding in real life.
  </p>

  <p style="  padding:12px; margin:10px 0;   color:black;  ">
    Wouldn't it be great to include some guidance in the source code itself? To explain what your code does?
  </p>

  <p style=" padding:12px; margin:10px 0;   color:black;  ">
    That would help other programmers who may read your code. It might be useful even for yourself, especially
    if you have to look back at your code a couple of months from now. Luckily, each high-level programming
    language provides the means to include short inline explanations in the code.

  <p style="  padding:12px; margin:10px 0;  color:black;  ">
    These are lines of text called comments. In Python, a line of text that starts with a hash mark sign is
    a comment. The computer doesn't try to interpret or execute such lines. They are exclusively meant for humans.
  </p>

  <p style=" padding:12px; margin:10px 0;   color:black;  ">
    So, here's our code from the previous section. You may remember what each statement does. However, added comments
    can clarify everything in an instant.
  </p>

  <p style=" padding:12px; margin:10px 0;   color:black;  ">
    Python also supports multiline comments called documentation strings. A docstring starts and ends with a triple
    quotation mark, and it's used to provide longer explanation when necessary. The triple quotation mark that ends
    a multiline docstring should be on a line by itself.
  </p>

  <h2>When (and how) to comment</h2>

  <p style="  padding:12px; margin:10px 0;   color:black;  ">
    Having that said, you don't have to comment every line of code. So, when do you write comments?
  </p>

  <ul style="  padding:12px; margin:10px 0 20px 0;   color:black;  ">
    <li style="margin:6px 0;">It's a good idea to explain parts of your code that provide specific functionality.</li>
    <li style="margin:6px 0;">You should also comment code that's not straightforward or to clear up confusion.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Rules for good comments</h2>

  <p style="  padding:12px; margin:10px 0;   color:black;  ">
    Finally, here are some rules for writing good comments:
  </p>

  <ol style="  padding:12px; margin:10px 0 20px 0;   color:black;  ">
    <li style="margin:6px 0;">Comments should be complete sentences, but keep them brief and concise.</li>
    <li style="margin:6px 0;">If your code changes, make sure to also update the comments if required.</li>
  </ol>

  <p style="  padding:12px; margin:10px 0;  color:black;  ">
    Helpful comments can help understand your code faster, and as a consequence, reduce the time required
    to maintain or enhance the program.
  </p>

    <h1>Variables in Python</h1>

    <p style="color:black; line-height:1.6;">
      We have used variables in the previous lessons.
    </p>

    <p style="color:black; line-height:1.6;">
      They are containers used to store data that can be accessed or changed
      while the program is running. A variable is a dedicated location from the computer's memory.
      We tag it with a name that allows us to identify it later.
    </p>

    <p style="color:black; line-height:1.6;">
      Then, we can put a value in it.
    </p>

    <p style="color:black; line-height:1.6;">
      All right, let's open up VSCode.
    </p>

    <p style="color:black; line-height:1.6;">
      I create a new file as usual, and save it as <code>variables.py</code>. In Python,
      you create a variable by typing a name.
    </p>

    <p style="color:black; line-height:1.6;">
      The name represents the data that you want to hold in that variable,
      so better provide a meaningful one.
    </p>

    <p style="color:black; line-height:1.6;">
      Say that you need a variable that stores the player's name.
    </p>

    <p style="color:black; line-height:1.6;">
      Now, you could name your variable "x," or "n," or anything that comes to your mind. But how about this version?
      It's definitely a better choice, as it describes clearly the purpose of this variable. We've just created a variable called "name" and we used the equal
      sign to store the value "John" in it.
    </p>

    <p style="color:black; line-height:1.6;">
      It's like saying: "Hey computer, here's the variable called "name." Store the value "John" in it.
    </p>

    <p style="color:black; line-height:1.6;">
      Technically speaking, the value John is a string literal. We call literals predefined values that cannot
      change. The equals sign is called assignment operator - which makes sense, as it actually assigns a value.
    </p>

    <p style="color:black; line-height:1.6;">
      Now, after this line of code, the "name" variable exists, and it can be used to retrieve the value it holds.
      Bear in mind that you cannot use a variable before declaring it.
    </p>

     
     

     

    <p style="color:black; line-height:1.6;">
      Variables can be assigned to new values after defining them - that's why they are called variables after all. We can update the value stored in the "name" variable by assigning it a new value.
      Running this code produces the following output in the terminal: John and Steve. Now, add another statement, and let us print it, too.
    </p>

    <p style="color:black; line-height:1.6;">
      Now, we've got John, Steve and Sam. Besides providing meaningful, descriptive names for our variables,
      we need to follow certain rules called naming conventions. Variable names should be lower case. For example,
      "temperature" starts with a lowercase "t."
    </p>

    <p style="color:black; line-height:1.6;">
      Or "text" = "Done" also starts with a lowercase "t." We could change the name of the variable "temperature" to start with the uppercase "T," but that's not recommended.
    </p>

    <p style="color:black; line-height:1.6;">
      If the variable name consists of multiple words, separate them using underscores like in the following examples.
    </p>

    <p style="color:black; line-height:1.6;">
      Other programming languages use the lowerCamelCase style for variables, where you start with the lowercase word, and all successive words are capitalized, like "firstName," "lastName," and so on. Python prefers the underscore separated style as described in the Style Guide for Python Code.
    </p>

    <p style="color:black; line-height:1.6;">
      In Python, variable names must start with a letter or an underscore - other characters are not allowed.
    </p>

     

     

     

    <p style="color:black; line-height:1.6;">
      Here's a summary of the rules you need to follow when creating your variables:
    </p>

    <ul style="color:black; line-height:1.6;">
      <li>Provide short, descriptive names</li>
      <li>Start your variable names with a letter</li>
      <li>You can also use underscores, but that's a special case, and we'll talk about its meaning later.</li>
      <li>Use the underscore separated style if your variable name consists of multiple words. Following the standard naming conventions and coding style will make your code look more professional and easier to understand.</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="color:black; line-height:1.6;">
      Now that you know how to declare and name your variables let's dig deeper into how we can use them.
    </p>

  </div>

<div style="border:2px solid #000; border-radius:8px; padding:18px; max-width:900px; margin:24px auto; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height:1.6;">


    <!-- Heading (NOT black) -->
    <h1 style="margin-top:0; color:#2b6ea3;">Working with Numbers in Python</h1>

    <!-- Paragraphs: inherit color black from inline style -->
    <div style="color: #000000; line-height:1.6;">

      <p>We've seen what a variable is: a container that can hold different values, with a name that allows us
      to identify it later and change its value if required.</p>

      <p>So far we defined variables that can store text data. Python variables can hold many other data types,
      including numbers. Besides strings, numbers are the most common kinds of values in computer programs.</p>

      <p>Now, open Visual Studio Code. Create a new file and save it as <code>numbers.py</code>. Let's define a variable.</p>

      <pre style="white-space:pre-wrap; padding:12px; border-radius:6px; border:1px dashed #ccc; background:#f7f7f7; color:#000;">
# This line creates a variable called score and stores the value 0 in it
score = 0
      </pre>

      <p>Note that I haven't used quotes around the value zero — that would make it a string literal. Although we
      use the "score" variable to store numbers, now it holds a string. Bear in mind that most programming languages
      wouldn't let us change the data type stored in a variable.</p>

      <p>Once you declare a variable as a number, you can't assign it a string and vice-versa. Python is less restrictive
      but that doesn't mean that we should exploit this flexibility. If you want to change the value of the "score"
      variable, to say 42 million you should write:</p>

      <pre style="white-space:pre-wrap; padding:12px; border-radius:6px; border:1px dashed #ccc; background:#f7f7f7; color:#000;">
score = 42000000
      </pre>

      <p>As you can see, I haven't used the thousands separator. That's because comma separated values have a different
      meaning in Python. The following line does not actually change the score to 42 million. Python interprets the comma
      separated value as a <em>tuple</em> (a list consisting of separate elements):</p>

      <pre style="white-space:pre-wrap; padding:12px; border-radius:6px; border:1px dashed #ccc; background:#f7f7f7; color:#000;">
score = 42, 0, 0
print(score)   # -> (42, 0, 0)
      </pre>

      <p>So, make sure you don't use commas as thousands separators when defining number literals in Python. We can also use negative numbers.</p>

      <pre style="white-space:pre-wrap; padding:12px; border-radius:6px; border:1px dashed #ccc; background:#f7f7f7; color:#000;">
balance = -200
print(balance)  # -> -200
      </pre>

      <p>Now, what if we want to use a value that's not a whole number, like say <code>28.88</code>?</p>

      <p>We can create decimals by defining number literals that have a point as decimal separators. Python treats
      the value as a <strong>float</strong> if the decimal point appears anywhere in it. All the following statements are valid. Don't use whitespace
      between the decimal point and the integer or the fractional part or else you'll trigger syntax errors. To create
      a negative decimal number, you just put the minus sign in front of it.</p>

      <pre style="white-space:pre-wrap; padding:12px; border-radius:6px; border:1px dashed #ccc; background:#f7f7f7; color:#000;">
x = 28.88
y = -3.5
z = 0.0
      </pre>

      <p>As you can tell, defining numeric values in Python is effortless. So, let's do some maths next.</p>

      <h1>Basic arithmetic operations</h1>

      <p style="color: black; line-height: 1.6;">We introduce the basic arithmetic operations, that is, addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.</p>

      <p style="color: black; line-height: 1.6;">Start VSCode and create a new file called <code style="color: black;">basic-maths.py</code>.</p>

      <p style="color: black; line-height: 1.6;">Let us create two variables <code style="color: black;">a</code> and <code style="color: black;">b</code>. I make <code style="color: black;">a = 2</code>, and <code style="color: black;">b = 4</code>. We can add them together using the plus sign and store the result in a new variable <code style="color: black;">c</code>. Python evaluates whatever is on the right hand side of the assignment operator and puts the result in the variable on the left-hand side of the equals sign.</p>

      <p style="color: black; line-height: 1.6;">Thus, the following code is not valid. Let's try to run it. And we've got the syntax error.</p>

      <pre style="color: black; padding: 12px; border: 1px dashed #ddd; background: #f8f8f8; overflow-x: auto;"># bad example (will raise SyntaxError)
2 + 3 = x
</pre>

      <p style="color: black; line-height: 1.6;">All right, so let's remove this line and make sure to keep the operation on the right-hand side of the assignment operator. Otherwise, you will get a syntax error. As we've seen, the operator for multiplication is the asterisk <code style="color: black;">*</code>. For division, we use the forward slash <code style="color: black;">/</code>. So, these are the basic arithmetic operators. You can't use any other signs or characters to perform these operations.</p>

      <p style="color: black; line-height: 1.6;">For example, none of the following statements will work. So again, these are bad examples. Let's get rid of them.</p>

      <p style="color: black; line-height: 1.6;">Python doesn't restrict us to perform a single operation. The following statement is completely valid, too.</p>

      <pre style="color: black; padding: 12px; border: 1px dashed #ddd; background: #f8f8f8; overflow-x: auto;">a = 2
b = 4
c = a + a * b - b
print(c)
</pre>

      <p style="color: black; line-height: 1.6;">Now, can you guess the result? What will be the value stored in <code style="color: black;">c</code> after evaluating this statement?</p>

      <p style="color: black; line-height: 1.6;">Let me simplify this for you by replacing the variables with their actual values. Some may be tempted to execute the operations from left to right like this: Two plus two equals four. Then multiply it by four, so we've got four times four which gives us sixteen. Finally, subtract four from sixteen, and we have twelve.</p>

      <p style="color: black; line-height: 1.6;">Let's print out <code style="color: black;">c</code> and run the program. So, why did we get six and not twelve? That's because we ignored the order of operations.</p>

      <p style="color: black; line-height: 1.6;">Most programming languages use operator precedence levels that conform to the order commonly used in mathematics. Multiplication and division have higher precedence than addition and subtraction. In other words, if an expression has multiple operators, multiplication and division get evaluated before addition and subtraction. Thus, <code style="color: black;">2 * 4</code> gets evaluated first, which is <code style="color: black;">8</code>. Then, we add two and we get <code style="color: black;">10</code>. And finally, subtract <code style="color: black;">4</code>. So, the result is indeed <code style="color: black;">6</code>. We can override these precedence rules using parentheses.</p>

      <p style="color: black; line-height: 1.6;">For example, we could do the following to add together the first two numbers before performing the multiplication.</p>

      <pre style="color: black; padding: 12px; border: 1px dashed #ddd; background: #f8f8f8; overflow-x: auto;">c = (a + a) * b - b
print(c)
</pre>

      <p style="color: black; line-height: 1.6;">Let's rerun it. In this case, the result is indeed twelve. Because of the surrounding parentheses, the addition <code style="color: black;">2 + 2</code> gets evaluated first. So, we have <code style="color: black;">4 * 4 - 4</code>. The multiplication <code style="color: black;">4 * 4</code> is performed next as it has a higher priority than the subtraction. Then, we evaluate <code style="color: black;">16 - 4</code>, so we've got <code style="color: black;">12</code>. If an expression contains operations that have the same precedence, Python evaluates it from left to right.</p>

      <p style="color: black; line-height: 1.6;">Consider the following example:</p>

      <pre style="color: black; padding: 12px; border: 1px dashed #ddd; background: #f8f8f8; overflow-x: auto;">x = 8 / 4 / 2
# Python evaluates left to right: (8 / 4) / 2 = 2 / 2 = 1
</pre>

      <p style="color: black; line-height: 1.6;">If we started with the second division, the result would be four because <code style="color: black;">4 / 2</code> is two, and <code style="color: black;">8 / 2</code> would be four. As you can see, the evaluation order matters. So, these were the basic arithmetic operators, and we're going to introduce a few more in the upcoming sections.</p>

      <h2>Next: String operations</h2>

      <p style="color: black; line-height: 1.6;">All right, let's talk about string operations next.</p>

       
    </div>




<div style="border:2px solid #000; border-radius:8px; padding:18px; max-width:900px; margin:24px auto; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height:1.6;"> 


  <h1 style="text-align:center; color:darkblue;">Python Strings Lesson</h1>

  <p style=" padding:10px; color:black;">
    We've seen how to define string literals. Now, let's see some more advanced examples of using and 
    managing text in our programs. Open up Visual Studio Code and create a new Python source file called 
    <b>strings.py</b>.
  </p>

  <p style=" padding:10px; color:black;">
    Next, create two variables and assign string literals to them. We can concatenate the two variables 
    using the <b>+</b> operator. The + sign here is not an arithmetic operation. Instead, we're telling 
    the computer to concatenate the string literal stored in "part2" and "part1" and put the result in 
    the "quote" variable.
  </p>

  <p style="  padding:10px; color:black;">
    Let's check the output by printing the "quote" variable. There should be a space between the two 
    sentences. Let's fix the formatting issue. We can combine multiple string variables and string literals 
    using the + operator. So, I can insert a whitespace by adding it here. And finally, add "part2" also. 
    Now, we've got the whitespace between the sentences.
  </p>

  <p style=" padding:10px; color:black;">
    We could also create the formatted string literal known as <b>f-string</b>. The formatted string literal 
    was introduced in Python 3.6. It's a convenient way to create new strings by evaluating the expressions 
    delimited by curly braces.
  </p>

  <p style="  padding:10px; color:black;">
    Example: <br>
    <code>f"{part1} {part2}"</code> creates a new string literal by replacing the expressions with variable values.
  </p>

  <p style="  padding:10px; color:black;">
    Formatted string literals let us create strings that contain other strings, integers, or decimals. <br>
    Example: <br>
    <code>name = "Michael"<br>
    age = 32<br>
    print(f"Your name is {name} and you're {age} years old.")</code>
  </p>

  <p style=" padding:10px; color:black;">
    Another example: <br>
    <code>car = "Tesla Roadster"<br>
    acceleration = 1.9<br>
    message = f"The {car} goes 0-60 mph in {acceleration} seconds"<br>
    print(message)</code>
  </p>

  <p style="  padding:10px; color:black;">
    Formatting numbers with f-strings: <br>
    <code>pi = 3.14159265359<br>
    print(f"The number pi is approximately {pi:.2f}")</code>  
    → Output: The number pi is approximately 3.14
  </p>

  <p style="  padding:10px; color:black;">
    Common string methods: <br>
    <code>len(message)</code> → gives number of characters <br>
    <code>message.upper()</code> → converts to uppercase <br>
    <code>message.lower()</code> → converts to lowercase <br>
    <code>message.swapcase()</code> → swaps uppercase ↔ lowercase <br>
    <code>message.count("stay")</code> → counts occurrences of "stay"
  </p>

</div>


<div style="border:2px solid #000; border-radius:8px; padding:18px; max-width:900px; margin:24px auto; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height:1.6;">

<h1>   Boolean</h1>

      <p style="color: black;"> In this lesson, we talk about a new data type called Boolean that can only represent the values "true" and "false." Start VSCode and create a file called <code style="color: black;">boolean.py</code>. In Python,</p>

      <p style="color: black;">we define a Boolean variable by assigning the value <code style="color: black;">True</code> or <code style="color: black;">False</code> to it.</p>

      <p style="color: black;">The values <code style="color: black;">True</code> and <code style="color: black;">False</code> are not surrounded by quotes, as they are not string literals, but instead reserved</p>

      <p style="color: black;">keywords used to create Boolean data types.</p>

      <p style="color: black;">As you noticed, the keywords <code style="color: black;">True</code> and <code style="color: black;">False</code> must start with a capital. The following statements are invalid,</p>

      <p style="color: black;">as the names <code style="color: black;">"true"</code> and <code style="color: black;">"FALSE"</code> - written as they are - are not defined in Python. The keywords <code style="color: black;">"True"</code> and <code style="color: black;">"False"</code> are special</p>

      <p style="color: black;">cases of integers.</p>

      <p style="color: black;">The value of <code style="color: black;">True</code> is 1, and <code style="color: black;">False</code> evaluates to 0. And here's the proof.</p>

      <p style="color: black;">We see 0 in the console because <code style="color: black;">False</code> evaluates to 0, and 42 times 0 is, well 0. And if I replace <code style="color: black;">False</code></p>

      <p style="color: black;">with <code style="color: black;">True</code>, guess what we get?</p>

      <p style="color: black;">Now we have 42 in the console because 42 times <code style="color: black;">True</code>, which is 42 times one, is 42. Although</p>

      <p style="color: black;">the practical use of Boolean may not be evident at first.</p>

      <p style="color: black;">They play a crucial role in programming.</p>

      <p style="color: black;">We can control how our program behaves based on Boolean conditions.</p>

      <p style="color: black;">For example, we might use a Boolean variable <code style="color: black;">is_valid_email</code> to control the execution of the program.</p>

      <p style="color: black;">Initially, the variable is set to <code style="color: black;">False</code>. The <code style="color: black;">is_valid_email</code> variable becomes <code style="color: black;">True</code></p>

      <p style="color: black;">once the user has entered a valid email address.</p>

      <p style="color: black;">After that, we let our program perform the next action like loading a web page or showing <code style="color: black;">"Registration Successful"</code> dialog. We'll get deeper into Booleans and conditional logic in the next section.</p>

    <h1>Conditional Code in Python</h1>

    <!-- All non-heading text uses inline color:black -->
    <p style="color: black; line-height:1.6;">
      The programs we've written so far were quite simple.
    </p>

    <p style="color: black; line-height:1.6;">
      We started executing the first line and continued to the next one, then the next one, and so on until we reached the last statement.
      Writing programs this way wouldn't make too much sense. We need to ask questions and make decisions.
    </p>

    <p style="color: black; line-height:1.6;">
      Even the most straightforward program will probably need some conditional code. In real life, we have to answer questions and make decisions based on the answers to these questions.
    </p>

    <ul style="color: black; line-height:1.6;">
      <li>Is the traffic light green? If yes, go!</li>
      <li>Seeing red? You better stop.</li>
      <li>Is there enough money in your bank account to cover that overseas trip? If yes, go ahead and book your travel.</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="color: black; line-height:1.6;">
      Similarly, in our programs, we need to have code that only runs if specific conditions are true. That's what we call conditional code. In Python, you write conditional code using the following syntax: the keyword <code style="color:black;">if</code> followed by a conditional statement and a colon, then the code you want to execute when that condition evaluates to true. If the condition is false, we run the code that comes after the <code style="color:black;">else</code> word.
    </p>

    <p style="color: black; line-height:1.6;">
      The condition isn't a word or a phrase, but rather something in the form "if a equals b" or "if money is less than the balance." The expression that follows the <code style="color:black;">if</code> keyword must break down as being either true or false.
    </p>

    <p style="color: black; line-height:1.6;">
      Let's continue with an actual example. Open up Visual Studio Code and create a new Python source file called <code style="color:black;">conditional-code.py</code>. Type the following code in the editor.
    </p>

    <p style="color: black; line-height:1.6;">
      First, I declare two variables. <code style="color:black;">balance</code> represents the bank balance and <code style="color:black;">money</code> is the cash we want to withdraw. Then, we have a conditional statement.
    </p>

    <p style="color: black; line-height:1.6;">
      If <code style="color:black;">balance</code> is greater than <code style="color:black;">money</code>. The colon character marks the end of the <code style="color:black;">if</code> statement. The statements following the conditional statement are four spaces in from the <code style="color:black;">if</code>. And I need to also indent the code that follows the <code style="color:black;">else</code> statement.
    </p>

    <p style="color: black; line-height:1.6;">
      Now, that's something new. To understand why we indent these code lines, we need to introduce the concept of code blocks.
    </p>

    <!-- Code example block (inline styling, text color black) -->
    <pre style="color: black;   padding: 12px; border-radius:6px; overflow:auto; border:1px solid #ddd;">
<code>
# conditional-code.py
balance = 1500
money = 200

if balance > money:
    print("Withdrawal successful. Don't forget to take your cash.")
else:
    print("Insufficient funds. Withdrawal denied.")
</code>
    </pre>

    <p style="color: black; line-height:1.6;">
      Save the file and run it. If <code style="color:black;">balance</code> is higher than <code style="color:black;">money</code> the program prints the success message; otherwise it prints the insufficient funds message. This is the core idea of conditional execution.
    </p>

    <h2>Code blocks and indentation in Python</h2>

    <!-- Paragraphs: inline CSS sets font color black and adds a border -->
    <p style="color:black;   padding:10px; margin:12px 0;">
      A code block is a section of code that gets executed together.
    </p>

    <p style="color:black;   padding:10px; margin:12px 0;">
      Python uses indentation to break down code into blocks.
    </p>

    <p style="color:black;   padding:10px; margin:12px 0;">
      Other programming languages use curly brackets for blocks, but the creator of the Python language decided to use indentation instead.
    </p>

    <p style="color:black;   padding:10px; margin:12px 0;">
      Fewer special characters mean less typing and less cognitive load for humans.
    </p>

    <p style="color:black;   padding:10px; margin:12px 0;">
      However, it may take some time to get used to it if you already used a C-based language like Java, C# or Swift, to name a few.
    </p>

    <p style="color:black;   padding:10px; margin:12px 0;">
      Now, if I unintend the statements from the if block, I'll get a syntax error.
    </p>

    <p style="color:black;   padding:10px; margin:12px 0;">
      That's because the code that follows a conditional statement needs to belong to a new block.
    </p>

    <p style="color:black;  padding:10px; margin:12px 0;">
      The conditional "if" statement is at the level of zero indents. The block following the conditional statement must have a higher indentation level.
    </p>

    <p style="color:black; padding:10px; margin:12px 0;">
      That's how Python knows those statements belong to a block, and that block of code is associated with the "if" statement. So, let's fix our indentation error by restoring the original indentation. All the statements that belong to a block need to be at the same level of indentation.
    </p>

    <p style="color:black;   padding:10px; margin:12px 0;">
      If I indent any of the statements differently, you'll notice that I'll get syntax errors.
    </p>

    <p style="color:black;   padding:10px; margin:12px 0;">
      Now, if I try to run the file, we get an indentation error "Unexpected Indent" for this line - line number 5. So, be careful to use proper indentation to delimit your blocks.
    </p>

    <p style="color:black;   padding:10px; margin:12px 0;">
      Python relies on the indentation level to figure out which statements belong together. We'll use blocks a lot as we proceed throughout this course.
    </p>

    <p style="color:black;   padding:10px; margin:12px 0;">
      Now that we clarified what code blocks are for, we can dig deeper into conditional code.
    </p>

  </div>



 

  <!-- Main container with border (inline CSS) -->
   <div style="border:2px solid #000; border-radius:8px; padding:18px; max-width:900px; margin:24px auto; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height:1.6;">

    <!-- Heading - no color forced here (exception) -->
    <h1 style="margin-top:0;">Comparison Operators & Conditional Statements</h1>

    <!-- All paragraphs, lists, code blocks and examples explicitly set to black color -->
    <p style="color: black; margin-bottom:12px;">
      As we've seen, a conditional statement must evaluate to a Boolean. In the previous example, we checked
      if the number is bigger than the other one, and I used the greater than sign to do that.
    </p>

    <p style="color: black; margin-bottom:12px;">
      There are also other operators that can be used in conditional statements. Besides greater than, we can
      check if the value on the left side is greater than or equal, less than, less than or equal to the value on the
      right. It is also ubiquitous to check for equality and inequality using the equals (==) and not equals (!=) operators.
    </p>

    <p style="color: black; margin-bottom:12px;">
      Here's the list of the comparison operators you can use in conditional statements. These comparison operators work
      with numbers, strings, and also other data types that can be compared with each other.
    </p>

    <h2 style="margin-bottom:8px;">Fixing the bank-withdraw example</h2>

    <p style="color: black; margin-bottom:12px;">
      Now, let's take a closer look at our previous example. What happens if the amount we want to withdraw matches the balance?
      It says "Insufficient funds." So, we couldn't retrieve the money because the condition
      <code style="color: black;   padding:2px 4px; border:1px dashed #999;">balance &gt; money</code>
      evaluates to false.
    </p>

    <p style="color: black; margin-bottom:12px;">
      Thus, the else-statement's code block will execute and print "Insufficient funds." We can fix the issue easily
      by replacing the "<code style="color: black;  padding:2px 4px; border:1px dashed #999;">&gt;</code>"
      operator with the "<code style="color: black;   padding:2px 4px; border:1px dashed #999;">&gt;=</code>" operator.
      The rest of the code remains unchanged.
    </p>

    <!-- Code example block (inline styles) -->
    <pre style="color: black;  padding:12px; border:1px solid #ddd; overflow:auto; border-radius:6px;">
<code style="color: black;">
balance = 100
money = 100

if balance &gt;= money:
    balance = balance - money
    print("Withdraw successful. Remaining balance:", balance)
else:
    print("Insufficient funds.")
</code>
    </pre>

    <p style="color: black; margin-top:12px;">
      Now, this small change will let us withdraw all the money from our bank account. After this transaction,
      the balance turns zero.
    </p>

    <p style="color: black; margin-bottom:12px;">
      Make sure you don't add a space between the "<code style="color: black;   padding:2px 4px; border:1px dashed #999;">&gt;</code>"
      and the "<code style="color: black;   padding:2px 4px; border:1px dashed #999;">=</code>" sign. That extra whitespace
      will cause a syntax error.
    </p>

    <p style="color: black; margin-bottom:12px;">
      So, let's undo our change. The "<code style="color: black;   padding:2px 4px; border:1px dashed #999;">=</code>,"
      "<code style="color: black;  padding:2px 4px; border:1px dashed #999;">==</code>" and
      "<code style="color: black;   padding:2px 4px; border:1px dashed #999;">!=</code>" comparison
      operators must be written together, without spaces between them.
    </p>

    <h2 style="margin-bottom:8px;">Assignment vs Comparison</h2>

    <p style="color: black; margin-bottom:12px;">
      Another common mistake is using a single equal sign in conditional statements. Let me show you what I mean.
      First, I create the <code style="color: black;   padding:2px 4px; border:1px dashed #999;">is_true</code>
      variable and set it to <code style="color: black; background:#fffef0; padding:2px 4px; border:1px dashed #999;">False</code>.
      If <code style="color: black; background:#fffef0; padding:2px 4px; border:1px dashed #999;">is_true</code> is
      <code style="color: black; background:#fffef0; padding:2px 4px; border:1px dashed #999;">True</code>, then print "True"
      else print "False."
    </p>

    <pre style="color: black;   padding:12px; border:1px solid #ddd; overflow:auto; border-radius:6px;">
<code style="color: black;">
# WRONG - assignment used instead of comparison (and in many languages this would be allowed)
is_true = False

if is_true = True:    # <-- syntax error in Python, assignment used as condition
    print("True")
else:
    print("False")
</code>
    </pre>

    <p style="color: black; margin-bottom:12px;">
      The "<code style="color: black;   padding:2px 4px; border:1px dashed #999;">is_true = True</code>" in the code snippet
      doesn't compare values. It is an assignment, so you shouldn't use it as a condition. In many other programming languages,
      assigning a value to a variable evaluates to true, and the "if" block gets executed. Python prevents us from making this mistake.
      Trying to execute this code will trigger a syntax error.
    </p>

    <h2 style="margin-bottom:8px;">Summary & Additional examples</h2>

    <ul style="color: black; margin-left:18px;">
      <li style="color: black; margin-bottom:6px;">Keep the "<code style="color: black;   padding:2px 4px;">=</code>", "<code style="color: black;   padding:2px 4px;">==</code>" and "<code style="color: black;   padding:2px 4px;">!=</code>" operators together.</li>
      <li style="color: black; margin-bottom:6px;">Use the "<code style="color: black;   padding:2px 4px;">==</code>" operator to check if two values are equal.</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="color: black; margin-bottom:12px;">
      Our examples so far involved both the "if" and the "else" statements. However, that's not mandatory.
      You can use the "if" statement by itself. For example:
    </p>

    <pre style="color: black;   padding:12px; border:1px solid #ddd; overflow:auto; border-radius:6px;">
<code style="color: black;">
is_raining = True

if is_raining:
    print("Take your umbrella.")
</code>
    </pre>

    <p style="color: black; margin-bottom:12px;">
      Bear in mind that you cannot use "else" without a preceding "if" statement. However, nothing stops us from using multiple "if"
      statements in a row. The code prints "The number is even," "The number is greater than ten" and "A dozen."
    </p>

    <p style="color: black; margin-bottom:12px;">
      As you may have noticed, I used a new operator. The percentage sign
      (<code style="color: black; background:#fffef0; padding:2px 4px; border:1px dashed #999;">%</code>) is the modulo operator,
      which calculates the remainder of the division. If modulo returns 0, there is no remainder, so the number is even.
      A non-zero remainder means that the number is odd. Since twelve divided by two is six, and the remainder is zero,
      twelve is an even number.
    </p>

    <pre style="color:  padding:12px; border:1px solid #ddd; overflow:auto; border-radius:6px;">
<code style="color: black;">
number = 12

if number % 2 == 0:
    print("The number is even")
if number &gt; 10:
    print("The number is greater than ten")
if number == 12:
    print("A dozen")
</code>
    </pre>

    <p style="color: black; margin-bottom:12px;">
      Now, let's change the value of the "<code style="color: black; background:#fffef0; padding:2px 4px; border:1px dashed #999;">number</code>"
      variable to eleven. It prints "The number is greater than ten." Only one of the "if" statements evaluates to true.
      Indeed, eleven is greater than ten, but it's neither even nor equal to twelve.
    </p>

    <p style="color: black; margin-bottom:12px;">
      Next, we talk about nested conditional statements and I'll show you how to make additional decisions.
    </p>

    <h1 style="margin-top:0; color:initial;">Using multiple conditions: if, elif and else</h1>

    <p style="  padding:10px;   color:black;">
      As you start using conditions in your programs, you will notice that a pair of if-else statements is
      rarely enough.
    </p>

    <p style="  padding:10px;   color:black;">
      Many times, you will need three or more conditions.
    </p>

    <p style="  padding:10px;   color:black;">
      One possibility is to use multiple if statements, as we did in this example. Now, there are cases when we need to check multiple conditions and execute the first one that evaluates to true.
    </p>

    <h2 style="color:initial;">Traffic light example</h2>

    <p style="  padding:10px;   color:black;">
      Take a look at the simplified flowchart of a traffic light. We could use multiple if statements to make it work in Python. If we use the if statements like that,
      Python evaluates each conditional statement. Is the light green? Yes, so print "Go!". Is the light yellow? No, evaluate next "if." Is the light red? No, next one. Is it flashing? No.
      The else statement's code won't run, as one of the if statements was true. But we know that the traffic light can only be in one of the states at a time.
    </p>

    <p style="  padding:10px;  color:black;">
      So, why evaluate the other conditions if we know that the light can only be either green, or red, or yellow? Performing the additional checks is unnecessary — we're just wasting resources and computing time.
    </p>

    <h2 style="color:initial;">The solution: <code>elif</code></h2>

    <p style="  padding:10px;   color:black;">
      The solution comes in the form of the "elif" keyword, which stands for "else if." Let's rewrite our code using "elif" statements. An "elif" statement can only appear after an "if" statement.
      The "if" statement gets evaluated first. If it's true, the "elif" and "else" statements are not evaluated. The first conditional statement - <code>traffic_light == "green"</code> is true.
      Therefore, the three consecutive "elif" and the "else" statements are skipped.
    </p>

    <pre style="  padding:12px;   overflow:auto; color:black;  ">
# example using if / elif / else
traffic_light = "green"

if traffic_light == "green":
    print("Go!")
elif traffic_light == "yellow":
    print("Slow down.")
elif traffic_light == "red":
    print("Stop!")
else:
    print("Invalid state.")
    </pre>

    <p style="  padding:10px;   color:black;">
      Now, what happens if we assign the value "red" to the traffic light variable? The condition in the "if" statement is false.
      So the first "elif" gets evaluated next. The expression <code>traffic_light == "yellow"</code> also evaluates to false.
      So, we process the next "elif." <code>traffic_light == "red"</code> is true. So, Python runs the associated block of code and prints "Stop!." The penultimate "elif" and the "else" statements are skipped.
    </p>

    <p style="  padding:10px;   color:black;">
      As you can see, it printed "Stop!." If you change the "traffic_light" to some invalid value, like "blue," none of the "if" or "elif" statements resolve to true. The code block belonging to the "else" statement gets executed, which prints "Invalid state."
    </p>

    
  </div>



 
  


 <div style="border:2px solid #000; border-radius:8px; padding:18px; max-width:900px; margin:24px auto; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height:1.6;">



  <h1 style="margin-bottom:16px;">Logical Operators and Nested If Statements</h1>

  <p style="  padding:12px; margin:10px 0; color:black;">
    Let's examine the code snippet with the nested "if" statements.
  </p>

  <p style="  padding:12px; margin:10px 0; color:black;">
    The nested "if" checks if "is_blinking" is true. So, basically, we're asking if the traffic light is red, and it is blinking at the same time.
  </p>

  <pre style="border:1px solid #ccc; padding:12px; margin:10px 0; color:black; overflow:auto;">
<code>
traffic_light = "red"
is_blinking = True

if traffic_light == "red":
    if is_blinking:
        print("Stop! The red light is blinking.")
    else:
        print("Stop! The light is red but not blinking.")
else:
    print("The light is not red. Proceed with caution.")
</code>
  </pre>

  <p style="  padding:12px; margin:10px 0; color:black;">
    What if we could express both conditions at once? Actually, we can do that! The statement above is completely valid Python code. The "and" word is one of the three Boolean operators, also known as logical operators. The "and" operator takes two expressions and it returns "True" only if both expressions are "True." Otherwise, it evaluates to "False."
  </p>

  <pre style="border:1px solid #ccc; padding:12px; margin:10px 0; color:black; overflow:auto;">
<code>
success = True
result_code = 200

if success and result_code == 200:
    print("Success")
else:
    print("Failure")
</code>
  </pre>

  <p style="  padding:12px; margin:10px 0; color:black;">
    If you run this code, it prints "Success." Both expressions in the "if" statement resolve to "True."  
    Now, assign the value "False" to the "success" variable and execute again.  
    The result is "False" because the "and" operator returns "False" if any expression is "False."
  </p>

  <h2 style="margin-top:20px;">Using <code>or</code> Operator</h2>

  <p style="  padding:12px; margin:10px 0; color:black;">
    The "or" logical operator takes two expressions, too. It returns True only if any of the expressions are True.
  </p>

  <pre style="border:1px solid #ccc; padding:12px; margin:10px 0; color:black; overflow:auto;">
<code>
first_name = "Ellen"
last_name = "Ripley"

if len(first_name) == 0 or len(last_name) == 0:
    print("Please enter your name")
else:
    print(f"Hi {first_name} {last_name}")
</code>
  </pre>

  <p style=" padding:12px; margin:10px 0; color:black;">
    "len(first_name) == 0" resolves to False, since "Ellen" has five characters.  
    "len(last_name) == 0" is also False, since "Ripley" has six characters.  
    So, we have "False or False" which evaluates to False, and the <code>else</code> block executes.
  </p>

  <h2 style="margin-top:20px;">Using <code>not</code> Operator</h2>

  <p style="  padding:12px; margin:10px 0; color:black;">
    The third logical operator is "not." It negates a Boolean expression.  
    In other words, placing "not" in front of a Boolean expression reverses its meaning.
  </p>

  <pre style="border:1px solid #ccc; padding:12px; margin:10px 0; color:black; overflow:auto;">
<code>
admin_user = False

if not admin_user:
    print("Access denied. You are not an administrator.")
</code>
  </pre>

  <p style="  padding:12px; margin:10px 0; color:black;">
    Here, <code>not admin_user</code> resolves to <code>not False</code>, which is <code>True</code>.  
    Thus, the program runs the code block associated with the "if" statement.
  </p>
 

</div>


 <div style="border:2px solid #000; border-radius:8px; padding:18px; max-width:900px; margin:24px auto; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height:1.6;">


  <h1 style="margin-bottom:16px;">Functions in Python</h1>

  <p style="  padding:12px; margin:10px 0; color:black;">
    In this section, we'll dive into functions. Functions allow us to write code and reuse it anywhere in our programs.
  </p>

  <p style=" padding:12px; margin:10px 0; color:black;">
    So, why is reusability important? Let me start by showing you an example. Let's start Visual Studio Code.
  </p>

  <p style=" padding:12px; margin:10px 0; color:black;">
    Next, I create a new Python source file called <code>functions.py</code>. We'll write a program that computes the area of a rectangle.
  </p>

  <pre style="border:1px solid #ccc; padding:12px; margin:10px 0; color:black; overflow:auto;">
<code>
length = 5
width = 4
area = length * width
print(f"The area of a rectangle with length {length} and width {width} is {area}")
</code>
  </pre>

  <p style="  padding:12px; margin:10px 0; color:black;">
    This code creates two variables: <code>length</code> and <code>width</code>, and assigns them the values 5 and 4.  
    Then, we calculate the area of the rectangle by multiplying the <code>length</code> by <code>width</code>.  
    Finally, I print a formatted string that displays the area.
  </p>

  <p style="  padding:12px; margin:10px 0; color:black;">
    Output: <em>The area of a rectangle with length 5 and width 4 is 20</em> ✅
  </p>

  <p style="  padding:12px; margin:10px 0; color:black;">
    Now, what if we want to calculate the area of another rectangle, which has a length of 21 and width of 12?  
    We can do that by changing the values of <code>length</code> and <code>width</code>.
  </p>

  <pre style="border:1px solid #ccc; padding:12px; margin:10px 0; color:black; overflow:auto;">
<code>
length = 21
width = 12
area = length * width
print(f"The area of a rectangle with length {length} and width {width} is {area}")
</code>
  </pre>

  <p style="  padding:12px; margin:10px 0; color:black;">
    Now, what's the issue with this code? Whenever we want to calculate the area of a new rectangle, we need to update the values of <code>length</code> and <code>width</code>.  
    If this functionality is needed later in the program, we'd have to copy-paste the same snippet again.
  </p>

  <p style=" padding:12px; margin:10px 0; color:black;">
    This leads to redundant code spread throughout the codebase. Our program becomes messy as we keep adding more duplication.
  </p>

  <p style="  padding:12px; margin:10px 0; color:black;">
    DRY is the acronym for <strong>Don't Repeat Yourself</strong>, a programming principle that reduces repetition and keeps code cleaner.  
    In Python, reusable pieces of functionality are called <strong>functions</strong>.
  </p>

</div>

 
 
<div style="border:2px solid #000; border-radius:8px; padding:18px; max-width:900px; margin:24px auto; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height:1.6;">



  <h1 style="margin-bottom:16px;">Defining Functions in Python</h1>

  <p style="  padding:12px; margin:10px 0; color:black;">
    We can create functions to wrap the code that we want to reuse. Use the following syntax to define the function in Python.
  </p>

  <p style="  padding:12px; margin:10px 0; color:black;">
    The <code>def</code> keyword shows that we are defining a function. Put a space after <code>def</code> and specify the function's name. 
    Function names should be lowercase, and use an underscore to separate the words.
  </p>

  <p style="  padding:12px; margin:10px 0; color:black;">
    Theoretically, you could name your functions anything you want. However, it is recommended to provide meaningful names, 
    which describe what your function does. Since the function defines a specific functionality, 
    it is recommended to start its name with a verb, such as <em>authenticate</em>, <em>calculate</em>, or <em>fetch</em>.  
    You can add a noun for clarity, like <code>authenticate_user</code>, <code>calculate_area</code>, or <code>fetch_sales_data</code>.
  </p>

  <p style="  padding:12px; margin:10px 0; color:black;">
    The function name is followed by parentheses <code>()</code>. Inside the parentheses, 
    we can specify the data you want to use in your function.  
    If the function doesn't expect any data, you can leave them empty. Otherwise, list the data you want your function to accept.  
    The input data a function takes is called a <strong>parameter</strong>.
  </p>

  <p style="  padding:12px; margin:10px 0; color:black;">
    If your function takes multiple parameters, you need to separate them by commas.  
    A colon <code>:</code> follows the closing parentheses.  
    This tells Python that we're done with the function's declaration, and the function's code comes next.
  </p>

  <p style="   padding:12px; margin:10px 0; color:black;">
    The function's code block must start on a new line after the colon, and must be indented.  
    The code block is called the <strong>function body</strong>, and it contains the statements that execute when the function gets called.
  </p>

  <p style="  padding:12px; margin:10px 0; color:black;">
    If the function needs to return a value, use the <code>return</code> keyword followed by the value or expression to return.
  </p>

  <h2 style="margin-top:20px;">Example: Defining Your First Function</h2>

  <p style="  padding:12px; margin:10px 0; color:black;">
    Open the <code>functions.py</code> file. We'll define a function named <code>calculate_square_area</code> 
    that takes a single parameter <code>side</code>.
  </p>

  <pre style="border:1px solid #ccc; padding:12px; margin:10px 0; color:black; overflow:auto;">
<code>
def calculate_square_area(side):
    return side * side
</code>
  </pre>

  <p style="  padding:12px; margin:10px 0; color:black;">
    This function multiplies <code>side</code> by itself and returns the result.  
    Now, let's use this function:
  </p>

  <pre style="border:1px solid #ccc; padding:12px; margin:10px 0; color:black; overflow:auto;">
<code>
print(calculate_square_area(5))   # Output: 25
print(calculate_square_area(10))  # Output: 100
</code>
  </pre>

  <p style="  padding:12px; margin:10px 0; color:black;">
    👉 This way, instead of rewriting the same code multiple times, we can simply call <code>calculate_square_area()</code> whenever needed.
  </p>

 </div>

  <h1 style="margin-bottom:16px;">Calling Functions in Python</h1>

  <p style=" padding:12px; margin:10px 0; color:black;">
    After defining our function, we can use it from anywhere in our program. However, a function's code isn't executed automatically.  
    Python has no way to know when do you want to run the function's code.  
    We need to write the code that calls the function and pass in the input data, if there's any.
  </p>

  <p style="  padding:12px; margin:10px 0; color:black;">
    We've already used some of Python's built-in functions. You probably recall the <code>print()</code> or the <code>input()</code> 
    functions used in the previous lessons.
  </p>

  <p style="  padding:12px; margin:10px 0; color:black;">
    We can call any function — including the ones we create — in a similar fashion: type its name and pass in the arguments, 
    that is, the values for its parameters (if it has any).
  </p>

  <pre style="border:1px solid #ccc; padding:12px; margin:10px 0; color:black; overflow:auto;">
<code>
# Function definition
def calculate_square_area(side):
    return side * side

# Calling the function
calculate_square_area(5)
</code>
  </pre>

  <p style="  padding:12px; margin:10px 0; color:black;">
    Bear in mind that there is a clear distinction between <strong>function parameters</strong> and <strong>arguments</strong>.  
    We use the term <em>parameter</em> when we define a function.  
    Upon invoking a function, the values that we pass in are called <em>arguments</em>.  
    In this function declaration, <code>side</code> is a parameter.  
    Whereas when we use the function, <code>5</code> is an argument.
  </p>

  <p style="  padding:12px; margin:10px 0; color:black;">
    Now, that you know the difference between a function parameter and an argument, let's analyze the code further.  
    Although the function's code will run, we can't see the result.
  </p>

  <pre style="border:1px solid #ccc; padding:12px; margin:10px 0; color:black; overflow:auto;">
<code>
result = calculate_square_area(5)
print(result)   # Output: 25
</code>
  </pre>

  <p style=" padding:12px; margin:10px 0; color:black;">
    This way, the return value from the function is stored in a variable and printed.  
    Now, we can see the result of our function call.  
    We can add further code and invoke the function whenever we need it.
  </p>

  <p style=" padding:12px; margin:10px 0; color:black;">
    👉 Functions help us structure our code into reusable units that can be called whenever we need that functionality.  
    I know it's been a long haul, but we're not done yet!
  </p>

 <h1>Function Definitions and Type Annotations</h1>

<p style="  color: black;">
You know how to define and use functions.
</p>

<p style=" color: black;">
There is a problem we need to solve, though. Currently, nothing prevents us from writing the following.
</p>

<pre style="border: 1px solid black; color: black; padding: 10px; background: #f9f9f9;">
<code>
def multiply_by_two(value):
    return value * 2

multiply_by_two("hello")  # This will trigger an error at runtime
</code>
</pre>

<p style="  color: black;">
Trying to execute this statement triggers an error. We can pass in any type of argument to our function because there are no restrictions regarding the parameter's type.
</p>

<p style=" color: black;">
However, the multiplication only makes sense for numbers. Python 3 and above allow us to annotate function parameters and provide type information. Annotations for parameters take the following form. So, we can annotate the type of the parameter our function accepts as follows.
</p>

<pre style="border: 1px solid black; color: black; padding: 10px; background: #f9f9f9;">
<code>
def multiply_by_two(value: int) -> int:
    return value * 2
</code>
</pre>

<p style="  color: black;">
Parameter type annotations inform the caller about the expected argument type.
</p>

<p style="  color: black;">
Note, however, that the caller may still provide an invalid argument. Unlike many other programming languages, Python doesn't impose any restrictions based on the parameters type. We can also annotate the type of a function's return type.
</p>

<p style="  color: black;">
Here's how we would specify that the <code>calculate_square_area()</code> function returns an integer. Besides type information, we can also provide default parameter values using the following syntax.
</p>

<pre style="border: 1px solid black; color: black; padding: 10px; background: #f9f9f9;">
<code>
def calculate_square_area(side: int = 1) -> int:
    return side * side
</code>
</pre>

<p style="  color: black;">
Let's provide the default value of one to the "side" parameter. The "side" parameter became optional, because it has a default value.
</p>

<p style="  color: black;">
We can call the function without passing in an argument.
</p>

<pre style="border: 1px solid black; color: black; padding: 10px; background: #f9f9f9;">
<code>
print(calculate_square_area())   # Output: 1
print(calculate_square_area(5))  # Output: 25
</code>
</pre>

<p style="  color: black;">
Okay, let's get rid of this line, and I'm gonna call the function without passing in an argument.
</p>

<p style="  color: black;">
Here's what happens. Because the "side" parameter's default value is 1, the function returned 1. The default value for parameters is useful if a function gets called with a specific value most of the time.
</p>

<p style=" color: black;">
Consider the following example.
</p>

<p style="  color: black;">
I define a function that creates Ferraris. The function takes a parameter called "color" and I provide the default value of "red."
</p>

<pre style="border: 1px solid black; color: black; padding: 10px; background: #f9f9f9;">
<code>
def build_ferrari(color: str = "red") -> None:
    print(f"Built a {color} Ferrari.")
</code>
</pre>

<p style="  color: black;">
The most popular Ferrari color is red, so it's an obvious choice to make red the default value. For the color parameter, calling the function without providing a value will print "Built a red Ferrari." But if we pass in a color, that value will override the default one.
</p>

<pre style="border: 1px solid black; color: black; padding: 10px; background: #f9f9f9;">
<code>
build_ferrari()           # Output: Built a red Ferrari.
build_ferrari("blue")     # Output: Built a blue Ferrari.
</code>
</pre>

<p style="  color: black;">
The parameter and return value annotations are optional in Python.
</p>

<p style="  color: black;">
Use annotations whenever they improve the clarity of your code.
</p>

<h1>Variable Scope and the Global Keyword</h1>

<p style="  color: black;">
To illustrate the problem we discuss in this lesson, I'm going to make some changes to our function.
</p>

<p style="  color: black;">
First, I'm going to delete this part as we don't need it anymore.
</p>

<p style="   color: black;">
And now, instead of using the "area" variable outside our function, I'm going to declare it inside the function's code block. So let's delete it from here.
</p>

<p style=" color: black;">
And I'm going to redeclare it inside the function. "area = side * side" and let's return it now.
</p>

<p style="  color: black;">
And now, I try to run this code.
</p>

<p style="  color: black;">
We got an error. It says "NameError: name 'area' is not defined."
</p>

<p style="  color: black;">
That's strange, right?
</p>

<p style="  color: black;">
Since we declared the "area" variable here.
</p>

<p style=" color: black;">
So, why is it invisible at this point? To understand why Python insists that "area" is undefined, we need to talk about the scope of variables. Any variable that's defined within a function has a local scope; that is, it can only be used inside the function where we declared it.
</p>

<p style=" color: black;">
Let's take a look at the definition of our calculate_square_area() function.
</p>

<p style="border: 1px solid black; color: black;">
We can access the variable within the function's code without problems.
</p>

<p style="  color: black;">
For example, I could insert a new print() statement that reads the "area" variable.
</p>

<p style="  color: black;">
I need to comment this line out. And if I run the file it compiles just fine.
</p>

<p style=" color: black;">
However, the "area" variable is not available in the code that's outside the calculate_square_area() function.
</p>

<p style="  color: black;">
So, again, if I uncomment this line, we'll get the usual error.
</p>

<p style=" color: black;">
It says "name 'area' is not defined."
</p>

<p style="  color: black;">
Python treats it in a similar way as if it wasn't defined at all - hence we got the NameError. If you need a variable that's visible both outside and inside the function, you need to declare it at the global scope.
</p>

<p style="  color: black;">
And here's how to do it.
</p>

<pre style="border: 1px solid black; color: black; padding: 10px; background: #f9f9f9;">
<code>
area = 0  # This is a global variable

def calculate_square_area(side):
    global area
    area = side * side
    print(f"Inside function: area = {area}")

calculate_square_area(4)
print(f"Outside function: area = {area}")
</code>
</pre>

<p style="  color: black;">
Now, let's pass in a valid value, say, 4 for the "side" and rerun the demo.
</p>

<p style="  color: black;">
Although this code compiled without errors, it produced unexpected results.
</p>

<p style="  color: black;">
The area should be 16 but we got zero.
</p>

<p style="  color: black;">
Instead, we still see that the area that's printed inside the function is correct: it's 16. But the second time we print it, it gives us zero.
</p>

<p style="  color: black;">
That's the initial value of the global "area" variable.
</p>

<p style=" color: black;">
In fact, the calculate_square_area() function did not actually change the value of the global "area" variable.
</p>

<p style="  color: black;">
Instead, it created a local one inside the function.
</p>

<p style="border: 1px solid black; color: black;">
Now, we have a global and a local "area" variable.
</p>

<p style="border: 1px solid black; color: black;">
The function assigns the result of the multiplication to the local "area" variable and leaves the global "area" variable unchanged.
</p>

<p style="  color: black;">
Python requires us to specify that we want to access a global variable inside a local scope explicitly.
</p>

<p style=" color: black;">
By re declaring it using the "global" keyword, we tell Python that we know what we're doing, and we indeed want to change the global "area" variable.
</p>

<p style="  color: black;">
The safety measure is needed to prevent accidental changes to global variables defined outside of a function. After these changes, we should see the right result.
</p>

<p style="  color: black;">
All right,
</p>

<p style="  color: black;">
now both print() statements are in sync.
</p>

<p style="  color: black;">
The "global" keyword allows us to access global variables at the local scope. However, as a rule of thumb, you should avoid relying on global variables in your functions.
</p>

<p style="  color: black;">
Global variables represent unprotected data, that might be accessed or changed by any function in the system without notice. Instead, you should pass in the data required by your function as arguments, and use the returned value after calling your functions.
</p>

<p style="  color: black;">
Next, we'll solidify everything you've learned so far by implementing a more advanced Python program.
</p>

 </div> 


 
<div style="border:2px solid #000; border-radius:8px; padding:18px; max-width:900px; margin:24px auto; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height:1.6;">
 
  <h1 style="margin-bottom:16px;">Area Calculator Program in Python</h1>

  <p style="  padding:12px; margin:10px 0; color:black;">
    You already know a lot about programming in Python. So, let's implement a slightly more advanced program.  
    We're going to write an application that calculates the area of circles, squares, and rectangles.  
    You'll be using conditional code, asking for user input, and you're also going to implement functions.
  </p>

  <p style="  padding:12px; margin:10px 0; color:black;">
    Let's start Visual Studio Code and create a new file called <code>area-calculator.py</code>.
  </p>

  <h2 style="margin-top:20px;">Step 1: Function for Square Area</h2>

  <p style="  padding:12px; margin:10px 0; color:black;">
    We define the function that calculates the area of a square first.  
    It takes a parameter called <code>side</code> of type <code>float</code>.  
    The function multiplies the length of a side by itself to find the area of the square and returns the result.
  </p>

  <pre style="border:1px solid #ccc; padding:12px; margin:10px 0; color:black; overflow:auto;">
<code>
def calculate_square_area(side: float) -> float:
    return side * side
</code>
  </pre>

  <h2 style="margin-top:20px;">Step 2: Function for Rectangle Area</h2>

  <p style="  padding:12px; margin:10px 0; color:black;">
    The second function is called <code>calculate_rectangle_area()</code>.  
    It computes the area of a rectangle.  
    The function takes two parameters: the <code>length</code> and the <code>width</code> of a rectangle.  
    We multiply these values to find the rectangle's area.
  </p>

  <pre style="  padding:12px; margin:10px 0; color:black; overflow:auto;">
<code>
def calculate_rectangle_area(length: float, width: float) -> float:
    return length * width
</code>
  </pre>

  <h2 style="margin-top:20px;">Step 3: Function for Circle Area</h2>

  <p style="  padding:12px; margin:10px 0; color:black;">
    The last function calculates the area of a circle using the formula:  
    <code>area = π × r²</code>, which is equivalent to <code>π × r × r</code>.  
    Here, <code>r</code> represents the circle's radius, and π (pi) is a constant, approximately equal to 3.14.  
    This is the ratio of the circumference of any circle to its diameter.  
    We can also use the exponentiation operator <code>**</code> to raise the radius to the power of two.
  </p>

  <pre style="border:1px solid #ccc; padding:12px; margin:10px 0; color:black; overflow:auto;">
<code>
PI = 3.14

def calculate_circle_area(radius: float) -> float:
    return PI * (radius ** 2)
</code>
  </pre>


</div>


 
 

<div style="border:2px solid #000; border-radius:8px; padding:18px; max-width:900px; margin:24px auto; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height:1.6;">

  
  <h1 style="margin-bottom:16px;">Area Calculator with User Input</h1>

  <p style="  padding:12px; margin:10px 0; color:black;">
    We now have all the three functions to calculate the area of squares, rectangles, and circles.  
    Let's print some information to the terminal.  
    I'm using a multiline string literal to display the string wrapped as you see it in the code editor.  
    If you want to create multiline strings, surround them with triple quotation marks.  
    Any line breaks, tabs or quotes will be included in the resulting string.  
    So, this code prints exactly what I typed in the editor.
  </p>

  <h2 style="margin-top:20px;">Step 1: Multiline String and Prompt</h2>

  <pre style="border:1px solid #ccc; padding:12px; margin:10px 0; color:black; overflow:auto;">
<code>
print("""
Select a shape to calculate its area:
    S - Square
    R - Rectangle
    C - Circle
""")
</code>
  </pre>

  <h2 style="margin-top:20px;">Step 2: User Selection</h2>

  <p style="  padding:12px; margin:10px 0; color:black;">
    Next, we ask the user to select the shape.  
    We're using the built-in <code>input()</code> function that prints the prompt string to the terminal and then waits until the user types something and hits Enter.  
    The <code>"\t"</code> sequence inserts a tab to indent the text after it.  
    The user should type 'S,' 'R,' or 'C' to select a shape.
  </p>

  <pre style="border:1px solid #ccc; padding:12px; margin:10px 0; color:black; overflow:auto;">
<code>
selection = input("Enter your choice (S, R, C): ")
area = 0
</code>
  </pre>

  <h2 style="margin-top:20px;">Step 3: Conditional Logic</h2>

  <p style="  padding:12px; margin:10px 0; color:black;">
    We now implement conditional logic.  
    - If the user selects <code>S</code>, we calculate the square’s area.  
    - If <code>R</code>, we calculate the rectangle’s area.  
    - If <code>C</code>, we calculate the circle’s area.  
    - Otherwise, we print a warning message.
  </p>

  <pre style="border:1px solid #ccc; padding:12px; margin:10px 0; color:black; overflow:auto;">
<code>
if selection == 'S':
    side = float(input("Enter the side of the square: "))
    area = calculate_square_area(side)

elif selection == 'R':
    length = float(input("Enter the length of the rectangle: "))
    width = float(input("Enter the width of the rectangle: "))
    area = calculate_rectangle_area(length, width)

elif selection == 'C':
    radius = float(input("Enter the radius of the circle: "))
    area = calculate_circle_area(radius)

else:
    print("Invalid selection. Choose 'S', 'R' or 'C'.")
</code>
  </pre>

  <h2 style="margin-top:20px;">Step 4: Printing the Result</h2>

  <p style="  padding:12px; margin:10px 0; color:black;">
    Last but not least, we print a formatted string that displays the area of the shape – or 0 for an invalid selection.  
    We use an f-String to display the area.
  </p>

  <pre style="border:1px solid #ccc; padding:12px; margin:10px 0; color:black; overflow:auto;">
<code>
print(f"The area is {area}")
</code>
  </pre>

  <h2 style="margin-top:20px;">Example Runs</h2>

  <p style="  padding:12px; margin:10px 0; color:black;">
    ✔ Square → Side = 12 → Area = 144  
    ✔ Circle → Radius = 42 → Area ≈ 5541.36  
    ✔ Rectangle → Length = 10, Width = 23 → Area = 230  
    ✔ Invalid Input (e.g., 'X') → Warning Message
  </p>

    <h1 style="margin:0 0 16px 0; font-size:24px; color:#0b5f8a;">Login Function in Python</h1>

    <!-- Everything else is paragraph text with black font -->
    <p style="color:black;">
      In programming, you'll encounter situations when you've got to repeat certain tasks. 
      Consider the following: we need to write a function that logs in the user based on a username and a password.
    </p>

    <p style="color:black;">
      Quite a common scenario, isn't it? If the login credentials are wrong, we prompt the user to re-enter the username and the password.
    </p>

    <p style="color:black;">
      We could start by implementing the <code>login()</code> function. The function takes two parameters: username and password, both of type string, 
      and we return a Boolean indicating if the login was successful or not. In the function's body, we define the 
      <code>is_authenticated</code> variable and initialize it to <code>False</code>. And now comes the authentication logic.
    </p>

    <p style="color:black;">
      The <code>if</code> statement performs a basic username and password check. To keep it simple, we just compare the username and the password 
      against predefined string literals. This approach is fine for this demo, but you should never use it in production code. 
      The function returns the value of the <code>is_authenticated</code> variable.
    </p>

    <p style="color:black;">
      Next, we use the function to authenticate the user. But first, let's prompt the user to enter the login credentials using the <code>input()</code> function. 
      Then we call the <code>login()</code> function with the provided username and password. The result of the call gets stored in the <code>logged_in</code> variable.
    </p>

    <p style="color:black;">
      If the login was successful, we print <q>Login successful</q>, otherwise we print <q>Login failed, check your credentials</q>. 
      To make this shorter, we can use a conditional expression (ternary operator) of the form 
      <code>Expression_A if condition else Expression_B</code>.
    </p>

    <p style="color:black;">
      Finally, we can enhance this by repeating the login process until the user enters correct credentials. This is done using a 
      <code>while</code> loop: <q>while login not successful, ask for user credentials</q>. Once the correct credentials are provided, the loop exits 
      and the program continues.
    </p>

    <!-- Code block -->
    <pre style="background:#f0f0f0; padding:12px; border-radius:6px; overflow-x:auto; color:black;">
def login(username: str, password: str) -> bool:
    is_authenticated = False

        is_authenticated = True
    return is_authenticated

    <h1 style="margin:0 0 16px 0; font-size:24px; color:#0b5f8a;">Using While Loop in Python</h1>

    <!-- Explanatory paragraphs -->
    <p style="color:black;">
      In Python, like in many C-based programming languages, we can use the <code>while</code> statement 
      to repeat execution until an expression becomes false.
    </p>

    <p style="color:black;">
      Here's the general form of the <code>while</code> statement. Note that the <code>else</code> clause 
      is optional. So, you can skip it and write <code>while expression:</code> followed by the code block. 
      The code that belongs to the <code>while</code> clause gets repeatedly executed as long as the expression is true. 
      In other words, the <code>while</code> loop tests a conditional expression and runs the body of the loop while 
      the condition remains true.
    </p>

    <p style="color:black;">
      Let's use the <code>while</code> statement in our login program to make it ask the user for credentials 
      until the login succeeds. We'll implement the logic in the form: 
      <q>while login not successful, keep asking for username and password.</q>
    </p>

    <p style="color:black;">
      We open <code>login.py</code> and implement the while loop. It tests the conditional statement 
      that follows the <code>while</code> keyword. In our case, we want to check if the login failed. 
      If the <code>login()</code> function returns <code>False</code> (meaning that the login failed), 
      then the condition <code>login(user, passw) == False</code> evaluates to <code>True</code>.
    </p>

    <p style="color:black;">
      This may look counterintuitive at first, but it's like asking: <q>Did the login fail?</q> 
      If the answer is <q>Yes</q>, then the loop executes again. Inside the loop, we first print a warning 
      message telling the user that the login failed. Then, we ask again for the username and password using 
      the <code>input()</code> function. This sequence repeats until the condition becomes false.
    </p>

    <p style="color:black;">
      When does this occur? When the <code>login()</code> function returns <code>True</code>. 
      In that case, the condition becomes <code>True == False</code>, which is false, and the loop exits. 
      At that point, the program prints a success message and continues.
    </p>

    <p style="color:black;">
      For example, if you enter wrong credentials such as username <q>Michael</q> and password <q>office</q>, 
      the program shows <q>Login failed, re-enter your credentials.</q> and prompts again. 
      After entering the correct credentials (<q>admin</q> / <q>1234</q>), the program prints 
      <q>Login successful.</q>
    </p>

    <!-- Code block -->
    <pre style="background:#f0f0f0; padding:12px; border-radius:6px; overflow-x:auto; color:black;">
def login(username: str, password: str) -> bool:
    is_authenticated = False
    if username == "admin" and password == "1234":
        is_authenticated = True
    return is_authenticated

user = input("Username: ")
pwd = input("Password: ")

while login(user, pwd) == False:
    print("Login failed, re-enter your credentials.\n")
    user = input("Username: ")
    pwd = input("Password: ")

print("Login successful.")
    </pre>

    <h1 style="margin:0 0 16px 0; font-size:24px; color:#0b5f8a;">Preventing Infinite Loops with Max Login Attempts</h1>

    <!-- Paragraph explanation -->
    <p style="color:black;">
      In the previous lesson, we created a program that asks for user credentials. We relied on the <code>while</code> 
      statement to keep asking for the username and the password until the login succeeds.
    </p>

    <p style="color:black;">
      Now, what happens if the user has forgotten the password? The <code>while</code> statement would loop forever—this is 
      known as an infinite loop, and it is one of the nastiest bugs in programming. As a rule of thumb, we should always 
      provide an exit condition to avoid infinite loops.
    </p>

    <p style="color:black;">
      In real-world authentication, users don’t get infinite chances. Too many failed attempts can lock you out of your account. 
      We will implement this behavior by tracking the number of unsuccessful login attempts.
    </p>

    <p style="color:black;">
      First, we create a variable called <code>attempt</code> and initialize it to 1. Next, we create <code>max_attempts</code> 
      to store the maximum number of allowed failed logins (for example, 5). We also create a Boolean variable 
      <code>is_authenticated</code> initialized to <code>False</code>. This will turn <code>True</code> only if the login succeeds.
    </p>

    <p style="color:black;">
      Inside the <code>while</code> loop, whenever credentials are wrong, we increment <code>attempt</code> by 1 
      (using <code>attempt += 1</code>). Then we check if <code>attempt</code> is greater than <code>max_attempts</code>. 
      If yes, we break out of the loop and lock the account. The <code>break</code> statement instantly terminates the loop.
    </p>

    <p style="color:black;">
      If login succeeds, we update <code>is_authenticated</code> to <code>True</code> and display 
      <q>Login successful.</q> After the loop finishes, we check the value of <code>is_authenticated</code>. 
      If it’s still <code>False</code>, we inform the user: <q>Your account has been temporarily locked.</q>
    </p>

    <!-- Code block -->
    <pre style="background:#f0f0f0; padding:12px; border-radius:6px; overflow-x:auto; color:black;">
def login(username: str, password: str) -> bool:
    return username == "admin" and password == "1234"

user = input("Username: ")
pwd = input("Password: ")

attempt = 1
max_attempts = 5
is_authenticated = False

while login(user, pwd) == False:
    print("Login failed, re-enter your credentials.\n")
    attempt += 1
    if attempt > max_attempts:
        break
    user = input("Username: ")
    pwd = input("Password: ")
else:
    is_authenticated = True
    print("Login successful.")

if not is_authenticated:
    print("Your account has been temporarily locked.")
    </pre>

    <p style="color:black;">
      Let’s test it: entering wrong credentials five times results in the message 
      <q>Your account has been temporarily locked.</q> But entering the correct credentials before reaching the limit 
      will display <q>Login successful.</q>
    </p>

    <!-- Heading -->
    <h1 style="margin:0 0 16px 0; font-size:24px; color:#0b5f8a;">Introduction to For Loops in Python</h1>

    <!-- Explanation paragraphs -->
    <p style="color:black;">
      The <code>while</code> statement allows us to repeat the execution of a block of code as long as the condition evaluates to true. 
      However, in many cases, we need to keep track of an index of some kind to ensure that we don’t loop forever. 
      In our previous example, the <code>attempt</code> variable was such an index, and <code>attempt &gt; max_attempts</code> 
      was the exit condition of our loop.
    </p>

    <p style="color:black;">
      Sometimes, that’s exactly what we want: execute the block of code a number of times and then exit. 
      The Python <code>for</code> statement provides this type of functionality.
    </p>

    <p style="color:black;">
      Let us create a new Python file called <code>for-loops.py</code>. Here’s your first for loop. 
      The built-in <code>range()</code> function generates integers from 0 up to, but not including, the provided stop value. 
      For example, <code>range(5)</code> creates the sequence of integers: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.
    </p>

    <!-- Code block -->
    <pre style="background:#f0f0f0; padding:12px; border-radius:6px; overflow-x:auto; color:black;">
for i in range(5):
    print("Called from within a for loop")
    </pre>

    <p style="color:black;">
      This code snippet prints <q>Called from within a for loop</q> five times. Next, let’s print the index and the iteration count. 
      Since the index starts at 0, we can increment it by 1 to display the iteration number correctly.
    </p>

    <!-- Code block -->
    <pre style="background:#f0f0f0; padding:12px; border-radius:6px; overflow-x:auto; color:black;">
for i in range(5):
    print("Iteration:", i + 1, "Index:", i)
    </pre>

    <p style="color:black;">
      The <code>range()</code> function can take up to three parameters: <code>start</code>, <code>stop</code>, and <code>step</code>. 
      The <code>start</code> and <code>step</code> are optional.
    </p>

    <p style="color:black;">
      For example, <code>range(1, 5)</code> generates the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4. The value of the <code>stop</code> argument (5) is not included.
    </p>

    <!-- Code block -->
    <pre style="background:#f0f0f0; padding:12px; border-radius:6px; overflow-x:auto; color:black;">
for i in range(1, 5):
    print(i)
    </pre>

    <p style="color:black;">
      The <code>step</code> parameter specifies the difference between each consecutive number in the sequence. 
      For example, <code>range(1, 5, 2)</code> creates the sequence 1, 3. We start at 1, then add 2, giving us 3, 
      but 5 is not included since the stop value is exclusive.
    </p>

    <!-- Code block -->
    <pre style="background:#f0f0f0; padding:12px; border-radius:6px; overflow-x:auto; color:black;">
for i in range(1, 5, 2):
    print(i)
    </pre>

    <p style="color:black;">
      By default, if we don’t specify <code>start</code> and <code>step</code>, the values are 0 and 1 respectively. 
      It’s important to highlight the difference between a <code>while</code> loop and a <code>for</code> loop. 
      The <code>while</code> loop executes as long as its condition is true, whereas the <code>for</code> loop runs 
      a block of code a finite number of times.
