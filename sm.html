  <h1 style="margin-bottom: 12px;">Introduction to the Stock Market</h1>

  <!-- Section 1: What Is the Stock Market? -->
  <div style="  padding: 14px; margin: 10px 0;">
    <h2 style="margin-top: 0;">1. What Is the Stock Market?</h2>
    <p style="color: black; margin: 8px 0;">
      The stock market is a place where people buy and sell shares (ownership units) of companies.
      When you buy a company‚Äôs share, you become a part-owner of that company.
    </p>

    <p style="color: black; margin: 8px 0;">
      Think of it like this:
    </p>

    <p style="color: black; margin: 8px 0;">
      If a company is a big pizza cut into 100 slices (shares), and you buy 10 slices, you own 10% of that company.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- Section 2: Stock Exchange -->
  <div style="  padding: 14px; margin: 10px 0;">
    <h2 style="margin-top: 0;">Stock Exchange</h2>

    <h3 style="margin: 8px 0 6px 0;">1. What Is a Stock Exchange?</h3>

    <p style="color: black; margin: 8px 0;">
      A stock exchange is an organized marketplace where buyers and sellers trade stocks, bonds, and other securities.
      It acts as a platform that connects companies that want to raise money (by selling shares) with investors who want to earn returns (by buying shares).
    </p>

    <p style="color: black; margin: 8px 0;">
      üß† Think of it like a ‚Äúsupermarket‚Äù ‚Äî but instead of groceries, it sells ownership in companies.
    </p>

    <p style="color: black; margin: 8px 0;">
      India has two main stock exchanges ‚Äî <strong style="color: black;">BSE (Bombay Stock Exchange)</strong> and
      <strong style="color: black;">NSE (National Stock Exchange)</strong> ‚Äî where investors buy and sell company shares under SEBI‚Äôs regulation.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- Section 3: How the stock market helps companies -->
  <div style="  padding: 14px; margin: 10px 0;">
    <h2 style="margin-top: 0;">The stock market helps companies in several important ways ‚Äî</h2>

    <h3 style="margin: 8px 0 6px 0;">Raising Capital</h3>

    <p style="color: black; margin: 8px 0;">
      Companies sell shares (ownership stakes) to the public through an IPO (Initial Public Offering).
    </p>

    <p style="color: black; margin: 8px 0;">
      This brings in large sums of money they can use to:
    </p>

    <ul style="color: black; margin: 8px 0 8px 20px;">
      <li>Expand business operations</li>
      <li>Develop new products or technologies</li>
      <li>Pay off debts</li>
      <li>Enter new markets</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="color: black; margin: 8px 0;">
      ‚û°Ô∏è Example: When Infosys listed on the stock exchange, it raised funds to grow globally.
    </p>

    <p style="color: black; margin: 8px 0;">
      The stock market helps companies raise funds, grow faster, and gain public trust by selling ownership shares to investors.
    </p>

 <div style="border:2px solid #444; border-radius:10px; padding:20px; max-width:900px; margin:0 auto; background:#ffffff; box-shadow: 0 6px 18px rgba(0,0,0,0.06);">



  <!-- Bond Market -->
  <div style="  padding: 14px; margin: 10px 0;">
    <h2 style="margin-top: 0;">Bond Market</h2>

    <p style="color: black; margin: 8px 0;">
      The bond market is where companies and governments borrow money from investors ‚Äî it‚Äôs also called the debt market or fixed-income market.
    </p>

    <p style="color: black; margin: 8px 0;">
      A company or government needs funds (for projects, expansion, or infrastructure).
      They issue bonds ‚Äî a promise to repay the borrowed amount (principal) after a fixed time with interest.
    </p>

    <p style="color: black; margin: 8px 0;">
      Investors buy those bonds to earn steady returns (interest income).
    </p>

    <h3 style="margin: 8px 0 6px 0;">Why Companies Use the Bond Market</h3>
    <ul style="color: black; margin: 8px 0 8px 20px;">
      <li>Raise Capital Without Giving Ownership ‚Äî unlike shares, bonds don‚Äôt dilute ownership.</li>
      <li>Predictable Costs ‚Äî they know exactly how much interest they‚Äôll pay.</li>
      <li>Flexible Financing ‚Äî can choose bond maturity, amount, and interest terms.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 style="margin: 8px 0 6px 0;">Why Investors Use It</h3>
    <ul style="color: black; margin: 8px 0 8px 20px;">
      <li>Regular income from interest payments.</li>
      <li>Safer investment than stocks (especially government bonds).</li>
      <li>Diversification in an investment portfolio.</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="color: black; margin: 8px 0;">
      The bond market helps companies and governments borrow money from investors while giving investors steady, fixed returns in return for lending.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- Commodity Market -->
  <div style="  padding: 14px; margin: 10px 0;">
    <h2 style="margin-top: 0;">Commodity Market</h2>

    <p style="color: black; margin: 8px 0;">
      The commodity market is where raw materials or primary goods are bought and sold ‚Äî like gold, oil, silver, wheat, cotton, and natural gas.
    </p>

    <h3 style="margin: 8px 0 6px 0;">How It Works</h3>
    <p style="color: black; margin: 8px 0;">
      Producers (like farmers or mining companies) sell commodities.
      Buyers (like manufacturers or investors) purchase them.
    </p>

    <p style="color: black; margin: 8px 0;">
      Trading can happen in two ways:
    </p>
    <ul style="color: black; margin: 8px 0 8px 20px;">
      <li><strong>Spot Market:</strong> Immediate delivery and payment.</li>
      <li><strong>Futures Market:</strong> Agreement to buy/sell later at a fixed price (used for hedging and speculation).</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="color: black; margin: 8px 0;">
      Example: A jewelry company may buy gold futures to lock in prices for the future.
      A farmer may sell wheat futures to protect against a fall in wheat prices.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- Derivative Market -->
  <div style=" padding: 14px; margin: 10px 0;">
    <h2 style="margin-top: 0;">Derivative Market</h2>

    <p style="color: black; margin: 8px 0;">
      The derivative market is a financial market where people trade contracts whose value depends on (or is derived from) the price of another asset ‚Äî such as shares, gold, oil, or interest rates.
    </p>

    <h3 style="margin: 8px 0 6px 0;">How It Works</h3>
    <ul style="color: black; margin: 8px 0 8px 20px;">
      <li>You don‚Äôt own the actual asset (like gold or a share).</li>
      <li>You just trade a contract that predicts how its price will move in the future.</li>
      <li>If you predict correctly, you make a profit; if not, you lose money.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <!-- Cryptocurrency Market -->
  <div style="  padding: 14px; margin: 10px 0;">
    <h2 style="margin-top: 0;">Cryptocurrency Market</h2>

    <p style="color: black; margin: 8px 0;">
      The cryptocurrency market is an online, decentralized market where people trade digital currencies that use blockchain technology for secure and transparent transactions.
    </p>

    <h3 style="margin: 8px 0 6px 0;">How It Works</h3>
    <ul style="color: black; margin: 8px 0 8px 20px;">
      <li>Cryptocurrencies are digital assets created and managed through blockchain (a distributed digital ledger).</li>
      <li>People buy and sell them on crypto exchanges (like Binance, WazirX, or Coinbase).</li>
      <li>Prices change based on supply, demand, and investor sentiment ‚Äî just like stocks.</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="color: black; margin: 8px 0;">
      The cryptocurrency market is a 24/7 digital marketplace where people trade blockchain-based currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum for investment, payments, or innovation.
    </p>
  </div>
 </div>


 <div style="border:2px solid #444; border-radius:10px; padding:20px; max-width:900px; margin:0 auto; background:#ffffff; box-shadow: 0 6px 18px rgba(0,0,0,0.06);">


  <!-- What is a Stock -->
  <div style="  padding: 14px; margin: 10px 0;">
    <h2 style="margin-top: 0;">What is a Stock</h2>

    <p style="color: black; margin: 8px 0;">
      A stock (also called a share or equity) represents partial ownership of a company. Owning a stock means you own a piece of the company and may benefit from its profits.
    </p>

    <h3 style="margin: 8px 0 6px 0;">‚öôÔ∏è How It Works</h3>
    <p style="color: black; margin: 8px 0;">
      Companies issue stocks to raise money for growth, projects, or paying off debts. Investors buy these stocks on the stock market.
    </p>
    <p style="color: black; margin: 8px 0;">
      Stockholders can earn money in two ways:
    </p>
    <ul style="color: black; margin: 8px 0 8px 20px;">
      <li><strong>Dividends:</strong> A portion of the company‚Äôs profits shared with shareholders.</li>
      <li><strong>Capital Gains:</strong> Selling the stock at a higher price than you bought it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 style="margin: 8px 0 6px 0;">Why People Buy Stocks</h3>
    <ul style="color: black; margin: 8px 0 8px 20px;">
      <li>Investment growth: Stocks can increase in value over time.</li>
      <li>Dividends: Earn regular income from company profits.</li>
      <li>Ownership & voting: Have a say in company decisions (for common stockholders).</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="color: black; margin: 8px 0;">
      Example: If you buy 100 shares of Reliance Industries, you own a small portion of Reliance. If the company grows, your shares may become more valuable, and you may receive dividends.
    </p>

    <p style="color: black; margin: 8px 0;">
      A good example of a stock is Apple Inc. (AAPL). When you buy Apple‚Äôs stock, you essentially own a small part of the company, giving you a claim on its profits and a chance to benefit from its growth. Investors can make money in two ways: dividends and capital gains. For instance, if you purchase 10 shares of Apple at $150 each, your total investment is $1,500. If the stock price rises to $200 per share, your shares would now be worth $2,000, giving a profit of $500. Similarly, if Apple pays $1 per share as a dividend, you would earn an extra $10.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- Benefits of Investing in Stocks -->
  <div style="  padding: 14px; margin: 10px 0;">
    <h2 style="margin-top: 0;">Benefits of Investing in Stocks</h2>

    <h3 style="margin: 8px 0 6px 0;">1. Potential for High Returns</h3>
    <p style="color: black; margin: 8px 0;">
      Stocks can provide higher returns compared to other investments like bonds or savings accounts. As the company grows, the value of its stock can increase, giving investors capital gains.
    </p>
    <p style="color: black; margin: 8px 0;">
      Example: If you bought 10 shares of Tesla at $200 each and the price rises to $400, your investment doubles, giving you a capital gain of $2,000.
    </p>

    <h3 style="margin: 8px 0 6px 0;">2. Dividend Income</h3>
    <p style="color: black; margin: 8px 0;">
      Many companies share a portion of their profits with shareholders in the form of dividends. This provides regular income in addition to any gains from selling the stock at a higher price.
    </p>
    <p style="color: black; margin: 8px 0;">
      Example: HDFC Bank pays dividends to shareholders. If you own 50 shares and the bank declares ‚Çπ20 per share as dividend, you earn ‚Çπ1,000 as regular income.
    </p>

    <h3 style="margin: 8px 0 6px 0;">3. Ownership in a Company</h3>
    <p style="color: black; margin: 8px 0;">
      Buying stocks means you own a part of the company. This gives you the right to vote on certain company decisions (if you own common stock) and a claim on its assets in case of liquidation.
    </p>
    <p style="color: black; margin: 8px 0;">
      Example: Owning shares of Infosys makes you a part-owner of the company. You get voting rights in annual general meetings to approve major decisions like mergers.
    </p>

    <h3 style="margin: 8px 0 6px 0;">4. Liquidity</h3>
    <p style="color: black; margin: 8px 0;">
      Stocks are generally easy to buy and sell on stock exchanges. This means you can convert your investment into cash quickly compared to assets like real estate.
    </p>
    <p style="color: black; margin: 8px 0;">
      Example: You can quickly sell Reliance Industries shares on the NSE or BSE anytime, converting your investment into cash without waiting for months.
    </p>

    <h3 style="margin: 8px 0 6px 0;">5. IPO Profits</h3>
    <p style="color: black; margin: 8px 0;">
      Example: When Zomato launched its IPO at ‚Çπ76 per share, an investor who bought 100 shares would have invested ‚Çπ7,600. On the first day of trading, if the shares opened at ‚Çπ100 per share and the investor sold them, the total value would be ‚Çπ10,000, giving a profit of ‚Çπ2,400. This shows how IPOs can provide quick gains, although not all IPOs guarantee profits. Investors who hold shares long-term can benefit from capital appreciation and dividends if the company performs well.

<div style="border:2px solid #444; border-radius:10px; padding:20px; max-width:900px; margin:0 auto; background:#ffffff; box-shadow: 0 6px 18px rgba(0,0,0,0.06);">


  <h1 style="margin-top:0;">Stock Exchange </h1>

  <div style="  padding:16px; margin-bottom:18px;">
    <h2>Primary Market</h2>
    <p style="color:black; margin:0 0 8px 0;">The <strong>Primary Market</strong> is where companies sell new shares directly to investors ‚Äî usually through an <strong>IPO (Initial Public Offering)</strong>.</p>

    <h3>‚öôÔ∏è How It Works:</h3>
    <p style="color:black; margin:0 0 8px 0;">A company decides to raise funds to grow its business.</p>
    <p style="color:black; margin:0 0 8px 0;">It issues new shares to the public for the first time.</p>
    <p style="color:black; margin:0 0 8px 0;">Investors buy these shares directly from the company (not from another investor).</p>
    <p style="color:black; margin:0 0 8px 0;">The money raised goes to the company ‚Äî not to other traders.</p>

    <h3>üè¢ Example:</h3>
    <p style="color:black; margin:0 0 8px 0;">Suppose <em>Zomato</em> wants to raise ‚Çπ1,000 crore. It issues new shares in the Primary Market through an IPO. People apply for Zomato shares at ‚Çπ76 per share. Once the shares are allotted, Zomato receives the money and becomes a publicly listed company.</p>
  </div>

  <div style="  padding:16px; margin-bottom:18px;">
    <h2>Secondary Market</h2>
    <p style="color:black; margin:0 0 8px 0;">The <strong>Secondary Market</strong> is where investors trade shares with each other, instead of buying directly from the company.</p>

    <h3>‚öôÔ∏è How It Works:</h3>
    <p style="color:black; margin:0 0 8px 0;">After a company issues shares in the Primary Market (through IPO), those shares get listed on a stock exchange like <strong>NSE</strong> or <strong>BSE</strong>.</p>
    <p style="color:black; margin:0 0 8px 0;">Then, investors buy and sell those shares among themselves through brokers.</p>
    <p style="color:black; margin:0 0 8px 0;">The company doesn‚Äôt receive money from these trades ‚Äî only the buyer and seller exchange money.</p>

    <h3>üè¢ Example:</h3>
    <p style="color:black; margin:0 0 8px 0;">You bought Zomato shares in the IPO (Primary Market) for ‚Çπ76. A few weeks later, the share price goes up to ‚Çπ120 on the stock exchange. You sell your shares to another investor for ‚Çπ120 each. Your profit = ‚Çπ44 per share ‚Äî this entire transaction happens in the Secondary Market.</p>
  </div>

  <div style="  padding:16px; margin-bottom:18px;">
    <h2>Stock Exchange</h2>
    <p style="color:black; margin:0 0 8px 0;">A <strong>Stock Exchange</strong> is a regulated marketplace where stocks (shares of companies) and other securities (like bonds and derivatives) are bought and sold. It acts as a platform connecting buyers and sellers of financial instruments, ensuring fair trading, transparency, and price discovery.</p>

    <h3>How It Works:</h3>
    <p style="color:black; margin:0 0 8px 0;">Companies list (go public) on the exchange through an IPO (Initial Public Offering) to raise funds.</p>
    <p style="color:black; margin:0 0 8px 0;">Investors then buy and sell these company shares on the exchange.</p>
    <p style="color:black; margin:0 0 8px 0;">The prices of shares change based on demand and supply, company performance, and market sentiment.</p>

    <h3>Example: Reliance Industries on the NSE &amp; BSE</h3>
    <p style="color:black; margin:0 0 8px 0;">Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) is one of India‚Äôs largest companies. It is listed on both the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). Investors can buy its shares using stock brokers and trading apps.</p>

    <h3>üç´ Example: ChocoLand Company</h3>
    <p style="color:black; margin:0 0 8px 0;">Imagine there‚Äôs a chocolate company called <strong>ChocoLand</strong>. The company wants to raise money to make more chocolates, so it decides to sell shares on the stock exchange. It divides the company into 1,000 small shares, each costing ‚Çπ100.</p>

    <p style="color:black; margin:0 0 8px 0;"><strong>üë¶ You as an Investor:</strong><br> You buy 10 shares of ChocoLand. So you spend ‚Çπ100 √ó 10 = ‚Çπ1,000. This means you now own a small part of the company.</p>

    <p style="color:black; margin:0 0 8px 0;"><strong>üìà After Some Time:</strong><br> ChocoLand becomes popular and earns more profit. The share price increases to ‚Çπ150 per share. You sell your 10 shares for ‚Çπ150 √ó 10 = ‚Çπ1,500. Your profit = ‚Çπ1,500 ‚Äì ‚Çπ1,000 = ‚Çπ500.</p>

    <p style="color:black; margin:0 0 8px 0;">A stock exchange is a place where people buy and sell pieces of companies (shares) to make profits when the company grows or the share price increases.</p>
  </div>

  <div style="  padding:16px; margin-bottom:18px;">
    <h2>How Does a Stock Exchange Work ‚Äî Step-by-Step</h2>

    <ol style="color:black; margin:0 0 8px 20px;">
      <li style="margin-bottom:8px;">Company Lists Its Shares (IPO): A company wants to raise money ‚Üí it offers shares to the public through an IPO. After the IPO, its shares are listed on a stock exchange (like NSE or BSE).</li>
      <li style="margin-bottom:8px;">Investors Start Trading: Once listed, anyone can buy or sell those shares through a stockbroker or trading app (like Zerodha, Groww, or Upstox). When you place a buy order, it is matched with a sell order on the exchange.</li>
      <li style="margin-bottom:8px;">The Exchange Matches Buyers and Sellers: The stock exchange‚Äôs electronic system automatically matches buyers and sellers based on price (best available rate) and time (who placed the order first).</li>
      <li style="margin-bottom:8px;">Trade Confirmation: The exchange sends a confirmation of your trade (both buyer and seller get it). The process is automated and fast, often completed in seconds.</li>
      <li style="margin-bottom:8px;">Settlement: Within <strong>T+1 day</strong> (Trade day + 1 working day), the exchange ensures the buyer gets the shares and the seller gets the money (handled by the Clearing House).</li>
    </ol>

    <p style="color:black; margin:0 0 8px 0;">üè¶ Example: You buy 5 shares of Reliance at ‚Çπ2,500 each through the NSE. Someone else sells 5 shares of Reliance at ‚Çπ2,500. The exchange matches your trade, confirms it, and transfers ‚Çπ12,500 from your account to the seller and 5 shares from the seller‚Äôs account to yours. All this happens safely and automatically.</p>

    <p style="color:black; margin:0 0 8px 0;">The stock exchange is like a super-secure online marketplace where people trade company shares, and computers automatically match buyers and sellers to complete the deal quickly and fairly.</p>
  </div>

  <div style="  padding:16px; margin-bottom:18px;">
    <h2>Benefits of Listing on the Stock Market</h2>

    <p style="color:black; margin:0 0 8px 0;">When a company is listed on a stock exchange (like NSE or BSE), its shares can be bought and sold publicly by investors. Here are the main benefits:</p>

    <ol style="color:black; margin:0 0 8px 20px;">
      <li style="margin-bottom:8px;"><strong>Raises Capital for Growth:</strong> The biggest benefit ‚Äî the company can raise large amounts of money from the public by selling its shares. Example: Zomato raised thousands of crores through its IPO to expand its food delivery business.</li>
      <li style="margin-bottom:8px;"><strong>Increases Company‚Äôs Public Image and Trust:</strong> Being listed gives the company credibility and brand recognition. Example: Infosys and TCS are trusted because they are listed and follow strict disclosure rules.</li>
      <li style="margin-bottom:8px;"><strong>Gives Liquidity to Investors:</strong> Once listed, investors can easily buy or sell shares anytime on the stock exchange. Example: If you own shares of Reliance, you can sell them instantly on NSE or BSE.</li>
      <li style="margin-bottom:8px;"><strong>Easier to Raise Future Funds:</strong> Listed companies can issue more shares or debentures in the future to raise additional money more easily (FPOs, rights issues).</li>
      <li style="margin-bottom:8px;"><strong>Provides Market Value for the Company:</strong> The company‚Äôs share price on the exchange reflects its current market value. Example: market capitalization calculation.</li>
      <li style="margin-bottom:8px;"><strong>Attracts Better Employees and Partners:</strong> Listed companies can offer stock options (ESOPs) to employees and attract top talent.</li>
      <li style="margin-bottom:8px;"><strong>Improves Transparency and Corporate Governance:</strong> Listed companies must follow SEBI rules and publish reports regularly, making them more accountable and trustworthy.</li>
    </ol>

    <p style="color:black; margin:0 0 8px 0;"><strong>üß† In Short:</strong> Listing on the stock market helps a company raise money, gain trust, improve liquidity, and build a strong public image ‚Äî all of which support long-term growth.</p>

<h1>Commonly Used Jargons in Stock Market</h1>

<div style="  padding:16px; margin-bottom:18px;">
<h2>Bull Market</h2>
<p style="color:black;">A Bull Market is a period when the stock market is growing, share prices are increasing, and investors are optimistic.</p>
<h3>‚öôÔ∏è How It Works:</h3>
<p style="color:black;">When the economy is strong, companies make good profits. Investors start buying more shares, expecting prices to rise further. This increased demand pushes prices even higher, creating a positive cycle.</p>
<h3>üìä Characteristics:</h3>
<p style="color:black;">Rising stock prices (usually 20% or more)<br>High investor confidence<br>Strong company earnings<br>Low unemployment and stable economy<br>High trading activity</p>
<h3>üè¢ Example:</h3>
<p style="color:black;">Between 2017 and early 2020, the Indian stock market was in a bull phase ‚Äî companies like Reliance, TCS, and Infosys saw their share prices rise sharply. After the COVID-19 crash in 2020, markets recovered strongly ‚Äî this was also a bull market.</p>
<p style="color:black;"><strong>üß† In Simple Words:</strong> A Bull Market is like a time of happiness and growth in the stock world ‚Äî everyone‚Äôs buying, prices are rising, and confidence is high.</p>
</div>

<div style="  padding:16px; margin-bottom:18px;">
<h2>Bear Market</h2>
<p style="color:black;">A Bear Market is when the stock market is declining, share prices are falling, and investor confidence is low.</p>
<h3>‚öôÔ∏è How It Works:</h3>
<p style="color:black;">When the economy is weak, companies earn less profit. Investors start selling shares to avoid losses. This increased selling pushes prices even lower, creating a negative cycle.</p>
<h3>üìä Characteristics:</h3>
<p style="color:black;">Falling stock prices (usually 20% or more from recent highs)<br>Low investor confidence<br>Weak company earnings<br>Economic slowdown or recession<br>Low trading activity</p>
<h3>üè¢ Example:</h3>
<p style="color:black;">During March 2020, when COVID-19 first hit globally, stock markets crashed ‚Äî fell sharply, creating a bear market. Another example: The 2008 Global Financial Crisis triggered a long bear market worldwide.</p>
<p style="color:black;"><strong>üß† In Simple Words:</strong> A Bear Market is like a time of caution and losses in the stock world ‚Äî prices fall, investors sell, and confidence drops.</p>

<div style="  padding:16px; margin-bottom:18px;">
<h2>Face Value of a Stock</h2>
<p style="color:black;">The Face Value is the fixed value printed on the share certificate by the company when it issues the share.</p>
<h3>‚öôÔ∏è How It Works:</h3>
<p style="color:black;">Suppose a company issues a share with a face value of ‚Çπ10. This ‚Çπ10 is the nominal value, regardless of the price at which it is traded later in the market. If the share trades on the stock exchange at ‚Çπ150, the market price ‚â† face value.</p>
<h3>üè¢ Example:</h3>
<p style="color:black;">Company Reliance issues shares with a face value of ‚Çπ10. When the shares are listed on NSE/BSE, the market price might be ‚Çπ2,500. Face value = ‚Çπ10 (for accounting, dividends calculation, and legal purposes). Market price = ‚Çπ2,500 (what investors pay to buy the share).</p>
<h3>üß† Key Points:</h3>
<p style="color:black;">Face value is fixed; market price changes daily. Face value is used to calculate dividends: Example: 10% dividend on ‚Çπ10 face value ‚Üí ‚Çπ1 per share. Helps in accounting and legal reporting.</p>
<p style="color:black;"><strong>üß† In Short:</strong> Face Value = original value of the share set by the company; Market Price = current price in the stock market.</p>
</div>

<div style="  padding:16px; margin-bottom:18px;">
<h2>52-Week High/Low</h2>
<p style="color:black;">52-Week High: The highest price at which a stock has traded in the past 1 year.<br>52-Week Low: The lowest price at which a stock has traded in the past 1 year.</p>
<h3>‚öôÔ∏è How It Works:</h3>
<p style="color:black;">Stock prices change daily based on demand, supply, and market sentiment. Over a year, these daily prices create a range: the highest point (high) and the lowest point (low). Investors use this range to understand the stock‚Äôs trend and volatility.</p>
<h3>üè¢ Example:</h3>
<p style="color:black;">Suppose TCS share has a 52-week high of ‚Çπ3,500 and a 52-week low of ‚Çπ2,800. If the current price is ‚Çπ3,400 ‚Üí it‚Äôs near the 52-week high, indicating strong performance. If the current price is ‚Çπ2,850 ‚Üí it‚Äôs near the 52-week low, which might signal weak performance or a buying opportunity.</p>
<p style="color:black;"><strong>üß† In Simple Words:</strong> 52-Week High/Low = the price range of a stock in the last 1 year. Investors use it to judge whether the stock is expensive, cheap, or trending.</p>
</div>

<div style="  padding:16px; margin-bottom:18px;">
<h2>Upper/Lower Circuit</h2>
<p style="color:black;">Upper Circuit: The maximum price limit a stock can rise in a day.<br>Lower Circuit: The minimum price limit a stock can fall in a day. These limits prevent panic buying or selling and reduce market volatility.</p>
<h3>‚öôÔ∏è How It Works:</h3>
<p style="color:black;">Stock Exchange Sets Limits: Based on the previous day‚Äôs closing price, the exchange sets a percentage limit for price changes.</p>
<p style="color:black;">Trading Stops at Limit: If the stock hits the upper limit, it cannot be sold at a higher price that day. If it hits the lower limit, it cannot be sold at a lower price that day.</p>
<h3>Example of Circuit Limit:</h3>
<p style="color:black;">If a stock closes at ‚Çπ100 yesterday and the daily limit is 10%: Upper Circuit = ‚Çπ110, Lower Circuit = ‚Çπ90.</p>
<h3>üè¢ Real-Life Example:</h3>
<p style="color:black;">XYZ Ltd. closes at ‚Çπ200 yesterday. Exchange sets 10% circuit limits. Upper Circuit: ‚Çπ220 ‚Üí price cannot go above ‚Çπ220 today. Lower Circuit: ‚Çπ180 ‚Üí price cannot go below ‚Çπ180 today. If XYZ hits ‚Çπ220 ‚Üí trading may be halted or limited for some time.</p>
<p style="color:black;"><strong>üß† In Simple Words:</strong> Upper/Lower Circuits are like safety brakes for stocks ‚Äî they stop prices from moving too much too fast in a single day to protect investors from panic and extreme volatility.</p>

<h2 style="color: darkblue;">IPO Process Step-by-Step</h2>

<div style="  padding: 10px; margin: 10px 0; color: black;">
    <strong>Step 1: Decision to Go Public</strong><br>
    A private company decides it needs money to grow, pay debts, or fund projects.<br>
    The company chooses to raise funds by selling shares to the public for the first time.
</div>

<div style="  padding: 10px; margin: 10px 0; color: black;">
    <strong>Step 2: Selecting Underwriters</strong><br>
    The company hires investment banks or underwriters to manage the IPO.<br>
    Underwriters‚Äô job:<br>
    - Determine the IPO price (how much each share will cost).<br>
    - Help prepare documents and market the IPO to investors.
</div>

<div style=" padding: 10px; margin: 10px 0; color: black;">
    <strong>Step 3: Preparing the Prospectus (DRHP)</strong><br>
    The company creates a Draft Red Herring Prospectus (DRHP) and files it with the regulatory authority (like SEBI in India).<br>
    This document includes:<br>
    - Business details<br>
    - Financial statements<br>
    - Risk factors<br>
    - Purpose of the IPO
</div>

<div style="  padding: 10px; margin: 10px 0; color: black;">
    <strong>Step 4: Regulatory Approval</strong><br>
    The regulatory authority (SEBI in India) reviews the DRHP.<br>
    Once approved, the company can officially launch the IPO.
</div>

<div style="  padding: 10px; margin: 10px 0; color: black;">
    <strong>Step 5: Marketing the IPO (Roadshow)</strong><br>
    Company management and underwriters go on a roadshow to meet potential investors.<br>
    Goal: generate interest and explain why investing in the company is profitable.
</div>

<div style="  padding: 10px; margin: 10px 0; color: black;">
    <strong>Step 6: Pricing the IPO</strong><br>
    Based on investor feedback, market conditions, and financials, the IPO price is finalized.<br>
    Shares are offered at a fixed price or through book-building (price range based on demand).
</div>

<div style="  padding: 10px; margin: 10px 0; color: black;">
    <strong>Step 7: Subscription</strong><br>
    The IPO is opened for public subscription.<br>
    Investors apply to buy shares through banks, brokers, or online platforms.<br>
    - If demand > shares offered ‚Üí oversubscription.<br>
    - If demand < shares offered ‚Üí undersubscription.
</div>

<div style="  padding: 10px; margin: 10px 0; color: black;">
    <strong>Step 8: Allotment of Shares</strong><br>
    Shares are allotted to investors based on:<br>
    - Lottery (if oversubscribed)<br>
    - Proportional allocation for large investors
</div>

<div style="  padding: 10px; margin: 10px 0; color: black;">
    <strong>Step 9: Listing on Stock Exchange</strong><br>
    Company shares are listed on a stock exchange (like NSE or BSE in India).<br>
    First day of trading: Investors can buy and sell shares in the secondary market.
</div>

<div style="  padding: 10px; margin: 10px 0; color: black;">
    <strong>Step 10: After IPO</strong><br>
    Company: Gains funds for expansion or other purposes.<br>
    Investors: Can earn money if the stock price rises (capital gains) or receive dividends.<br>
    Market: Shares now trade publicly, and company follows regulatory reporting norms.
