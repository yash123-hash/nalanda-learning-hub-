        <h3 style="color: #2980b9;">What is AI</h3>
        <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
            AI plays an often invisible role in everyday life, powering search engines, product recommendations, and speech recognition systems.
            Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the ability of a machine to learn patterns and make predictions. AI does not replace human decisions; instead, AI adds value to human judgment. 
            In its simplest form, artificial intelligence is a field that combines computer science and robust datasets to enable problem-solving.
        </p>

        <h3 style="color: #27ae60;">What is the Difference Between AI and Augmented Intelligence</h3>
        <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
            When learning about artificial intelligence, you’ll come across the term augmented intelligence. Both terms share the same objective, but have different approaches.
            Augmented intelligence has a modest goal of helping humans with tasks that are not practical to do. For example, “reading” 1000 pages in an hour.
            In contrast, artificial intelligence has a lofty goal of mimicking human thinking and processes. However, it’s important to note that AI today is not mature enough to perform independent tasks such as diagnosing cancer.
        </p>

        <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
            The first intelligence was human intelligence. This was the intelligence needed to operate the vehicle, to turn the steering wheel, to check mirrors.  
            The second form was artificial intelligence—when I turned on the self-driving feature, the car stayed in its lane, kept distance from the vehicle in front, and maintained speed, all with no input from me.
            When I got off the highway, I used a third form of intelligence: augmented intelligence. This included driver-assist features like collision detection and blind spot warnings.
        </p>

        <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
            Artificial intelligence refers to machines performing tasks that normally require human intelligence—reasoning, natural communication, and problem solving. It can replace human input entirely.
        </p>

        <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
            In contrast, augmented intelligence involves collaboration—machines and humans working together to enhance performance. Examples include screen readers, voice-driven navigation, and collision avoidance systems.
        </p>

        <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
            So, artificial or augmented? It depends on the task.
        </p>

        <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
            Machines are great at ingesting large amounts of data quickly, performing repetitive tasks with precision, and never getting tired.
            Humans excel at generalizing information, creativity, problem-solving, and emotional intelligence—crucial for roles like caregiving and customer service.
        </p>

        <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
            Augmented intelligence is the sweet spot that combines these human strengths with machine efficiency. It allows us to achieve things that would otherwise be impossible alone.
        </p>

        <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
            So, which is best? The answer is both. Augmented intelligence is how humans will thrive—working with machines to enhance safety, productivity, and innovation.
        </p>

        <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
            As computing power and data volumes grow, companies will adopt AI technologies to embed smart systems into applications, drive innovation, automate tasks, and boost efficiency.

        <h3 style="color: #333; border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd; padding-bottom: 10px;">What does AI do</h3>
        <p style="line-height: 1.6;">
            Artificial intelligence machines (researchers call them “AI services”) don’t think. They calculate. 
            They represent some of the newest, most sophisticated calculating machines in human history. Some can perform what’s called 
            machine learning as they acquire new data. Others, using calculations arranged in ways inspired by neurons in the human brain, 
            can even perform deep learning with multiple levels of calculations.
            <br><br>
            Imagine you are given the job to sort items in the produce department at a grocery store. You realize that there are dozens of 
            products and very little time to sort them manually. How could you use artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning 
            to help with your work?
        </p>
    </div>

    <div style="background-color: #fefefe; padding: 20px; border: 2px solid #aaa; margin-bottom: 20px;">
        <h3 style="color: #2c3e50;">Artificial Intelligence</h3>
        <p style="line-height: 1.6;">
            To separate the stone fruits, berries, and tropical fruits, you could create a programmed rule in the format of if-else statements. 
            This allows the machine to recognize what is on the label and route it to the correct basket.
            <br><br>
            A programmed rule might look something like this:
            <pre style="background-color: #f4f4f4; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #ccc;">
if berries_is_on_label:
    route_items_to_center_basket()
else:
    redirect_item_to_main_basket()
            </pre>
            Artificial intelligence makes this process more efficient.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div style="background-color: #fefefe; padding: 20px; border: 2px solid #aaa; margin-bottom: 20px;">
        <h3 style="color: #2c3e50;">Machine Learning</h3>
        <p style="line-height: 1.6;">
            To improve the performance of the machine, you expose it to more data to ensure that the machine is trained on numerous 
            characteristics of each type of fruit. The more data you provide for the algorithm, the better the model gets. 
            By providing more data and adjusting parameters, the machine minimizes errors by repetitive guesswork.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div style="background-color: #fefefe; padding: 20px; border: 2px solid #aaa; margin-bottom: 20px;">
        <h3 style="color: #2c3e50;">Deep Learning</h3>
        <p style="line-height: 1.6;">
            The grocery store has expanded its produce selection to include more varieties such as nectarines and plums (stone fruits), 
            blackberries and cranberries (berries), and mangoes and star fruit (tropical fruits). In addition, the products now come in 
            different sizes, shapes, and colors.
            <br><br>
            What makes deep learning different?
            <br><br>
            Deep learning models eliminate the need for feature extractions. For your work in the product department, you decide to use 
            algorithms based on deep learning to sort fruit by removing the need to define what each product looks like. Feature extraction 
            is built into the process without human input. Once you have provided the deep learning model with dozens of fruit pictures, 
            it processes the images through different layers of neural networks. The layers can then learn an implicit representation of 
            the raw data on their own.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div style="background-color: #fefefe; padding: 20px; border: 2px solid #aaa; margin-bottom: 20px;">
        <h3 style="color: #2c3e50;">Analysis</h3>
        <p style="line-height: 1.6;">
            AI services can take in or ingest enormous amounts of data and apply mathematical calculations to analyze, sort, and organize data 
            in ways that would have been considered impossible only a few years ago.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div style="background-color: #fefefe; padding: 20px; border: 2px solid #aaa;">
        <h3 style="color: #2c3e50;">Prediction</h3>
        <p style="line-height: 1.6;">
            AI services use data analysis to make predictions based on this information—a certain thing will probably happen. This is what AI 
            services do! Based on data analysis, they make predictions. It might not seem like much, but that analysis and those predictions 
            can have an enormous impact on human life.
            <br><br>
            Before you move on, take a moment to compare “analysis” and “prediction” to the guess you made earlier. Are you surprised? 
            If so, you might be wondering how those two seemingly simple actions can be so important.
        </p>
    </div>
 <h3 style="color: #2c3e50; border-bottom: 2px solid #3498db; padding-bottom: 5px;">What predictions can AI make</h3>
  <p style="background-color: #ffffff; border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px;">
    Most people have a love-hate relationship with the autocorrect feature on phones or computers. What’s happening when you enter a misspelled word? And how does the machine know to suggest a better spelling?
    <br><br>
    Simply put, the software analyzes what you’ve typed so far and predicts a likely correction. Your phone or computer (or its online service) has more than just a dictionary of correct spellings. It has a huge library of phrases that humans use in certain contexts on many subjects. So, when you enter a word that’s not in its dictionary, it begins analyzing and predicting and suggests the word you need. Predictions aren’t always accurate. But if they’re correct often enough, they’re useful and can save you time.
    <br><br>
    Here are more ways that AI uses data to make predictions.
  </p>

  <h3 style="color: #2c3e50; border-bottom: 2px solid #e67e22; padding-bottom: 5px;">Human Language</h3>
  <p style="background-color: #fff8e6; border: 1px solid #e6c994; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px;">
    Online chatbots use natural language processing (NLP) to analyze poorly typed or spoken questions, then predict which answers to give on topics ranging from shipping or business hours to merchandise and sizes.
  </p>

  <h3 style="color: #2c3e50; border-bottom: 2px solid #27ae60; padding-bottom: 5px;">Vision Recognition</h3>
  <p style="background-color: #e6f9ec; border: 1px solid #bfe6cd; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px;">
    AI helps doctors identify serious diseases based on unusual symptoms and early-warning signs, and it reads speed limit and stop signs as it guides cars through traffic.
  </p>

  <h3 style="color: #2c3e50; border-bottom: 2px solid #c0392b; padding-bottom: 5px;">Fraud Detection</h3>
  <p style="background-color: #fdecea; border: 1px solid #f5c6c6; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px;">
    AI analyzes patterns created when thousands of bank customers make credit card purchases, then predicts which charges might be the result of identity theft.
  </p>

  <h3 style="color: #2c3e50; border-bottom: 2px solid #8e44ad; padding-bottom: 5px;">Impact of AI on the World</h3>
  <p style="background-color: #f3e6f9; border: 1px solid #d7c4e6; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px;">
    Artificial intelligence is here whether we like it or not. Artificial intelligence, machine learning, robots... It's exciting also very frightening. Some of the biggest names in science and technology warn about the dangers of using artificial intelligence to make weapons. The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race. This is really like the scariest problem for me. That's where we need the regulators come in and say: Hey guys you'll need to pause and make sure this is safe. 
    <br><br>
    Artificial intelligence has the potential to solve all of the most difficult problems of today and tomorrow. AI will impact everything. There's nothing it won't touch. It is a renaissance. It is a golden age. Robots let people do more than they could by themselves. 
    <br><br>
    What do we want to use AI for--to solve problems, to be more prosperous, and to be healthy. That has to be its purpose. With artificial intelligence, the computers start to learn, to think, to re-write, to design their own programs. AI can give us the ability to hear better, to see better, to give us new capacities that we never had before. You can pair a human doctor plus an artificial intelligence system to create new drugs that humans in a lab might not have considered before. You could see incredible expansion in lifetimes. 
    <br><br>
    This all sounds very Star Trek, but, believe me, that's going to happen. The question is are we going to be smart enough to make choices as to what we want as a society. Scientists are creating AI today and setting the course for a new tomorrow. How AI changes our lives now and in the future is up to us. We're at this fork in the road where if we get things right with AI we can help life flourish like never before and really bring out the best of us. Today’s AI has gone beyond creating driving directions, vacuuming floors, or recommending new fashions. Now it really can mimic the capabilities of the human mind. AI can learn from examples and experience, recognize objects, understand and respond to language, and solve problems. Even more exciting are its future possibilities. Read on to see how AI might evolve over the next half-century.
  </p>
<h3 style="color: #2c3e50;">How is AI evolving</h3>
  <p style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 15px; background-color: #ffffff; border-radius: 5px;">
    Computer scientists have identified three levels of AI based on predicted growth in its ability to analyze data and make predictions. They call these levels:
    <br><br>
    <strong>Narrow AI</strong><br>
    <strong>Broad AI</strong><br>
    <strong>General AI</strong>
  </p>

  <h3 style="color: #2980b9;">Narrow AI</h3>
  <p style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 15px; background-color: #fefefe; border-radius: 5px;">
    Narrow AI is focused on addressing a single task such as predicting your next purchase or planning your day. 
    Narrow AI is scaling very quickly in the consumer world, in which there are a lot of common tasks and data to train AI systems. 
    For example, you can buy a book with a voice-based device. 
    Narrow AI also enables robust applications, such as using Siri on an iPhone, the Amazon recommendation engine, autonomous vehicles, and more. 
    Narrow AI systems like Siri have conversational capabilities, but only if you stick to the script.
  </p>

  <h3 style="color: #27ae60;">Broad AI</h3>
  <p style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 15px; background-color: #fefefe; border-radius: 5px;">
    Broad AI is a midpoint between Narrow and General AI. 
    Rather than being limited to a single task, Broad AI systems are more versatile and can handle a wider range of related tasks. 
    Broad AI is focused on integrating AI within a specific business process where companies need business- and enterprise-specific knowledge and data to train this type of system. 
    Newer Broad AI systems predict global weather, trace pandemics, and help businesses predict future trends.
  </p>

  <h3 style="color: #8e44ad;">General AI</h3>
  <p style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 15px; background-color: #fefefe; border-radius: 5px;">
    General AI refers to machines that can perform any intellectual task that a human can. 
    Currently, AI does not have the ability to think abstractly, strategize, and use previous experiences to come up with new, creative ideas as humans do, such as inventing a new product or responding to people with appropriate emotions. 
    And don't worry, AI is nowhere near this point. There might be another level, known as artificial superintelligence (ASI) that could appear near the end of this century. 
    Then machines might become self-aware! Even then, no levels of AI are expected to replace or dominate you. 
    Instead, scientists hope AI will extend humans’ ability to lead richer lives.

<h1 style="text-align: center; color: #333;">Three Eras of Computing</h1>

    <div style="background-color: #fff; padding: 20px; border: 2px solid #ccc; margin-bottom: 20px;">
        <h3 style="color: #2a4d69;">The Era of Tabulation</h3>
        <p>
            For centuries, people have struggled to understand the meaning that’s hidden in large amounts of data. After all, it’s one thing to estimate how many trees grow in a million square miles of forest. It’s something else to classify what species of trees they are, how they cluster at different altitudes, and what could be built with the wood they provide. That information can be difficult to extract from a very large amount of data. Because it's hard to see without help, scientists call this dark data. It’s information without a structure: just a huge, unsorted mess of facts.

            To sort out unstructured data, humans have created many different calculating machines. Over 2000 years ago, tax collectors for Emperor Qin Shihuang used the abacus—a device with beads on wires—to break down tax receipts and arrange them into categories. From this, they could determine how much the Emperor should spend on building extensions to the Great Wall of China.

            In England during the mid-1800s, Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace designed (but never finished) what they called a “difference engine” designed to handle complex calculations using logarithms and trigonometry. Had they built it, the difference engine might have helped the English Navy build tables of ocean tides and depth soundings that could guide English sailors through rough waters.

            By the late 1880s, people were thinking about how to develop faster systems to record data. Herman Hollerith, inspired by train conductors using holes punched in different positions on a railway ticket to record traveler details, invented the recording of data on a machine-readable punched card. Hollerith’s cards were used for the 1890 US Census, which finished months ahead of schedule and under budget. Later versions of tabulating machines had broad applications in business, such as financial accounting and data processing.

            The word to remember across those twenty centuries is <strong>tabulate</strong>. Think of tabulation as “slicing and dicing” data to give it a structure, so that people can uncover patterns of useful information. You tabulate when you want to get a feel for what all those columns and rows of data in a table really mean.

            Researchers call these centuries the <strong>Era of Tabulation</strong>, a time when machines helped humans sort data into structures to reveal its secrets.

    <div style="background-color: #fff; padding: 20px; border: 2px solid #ccc; margin-bottom: 20px;">
        <h3 style="color: #2a4d69;">The Era of Programming</h3>
        <p>
            During the turmoil of World War II, a new approach to dark data emerged: the <strong>Era of Programming</strong>. Scientists began building electronic computers, like the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC) at the University of Pennsylvania, that could run more than one kind of instruction (today we call those “programs”) in order to do more than one kind of calculation. ENIAC, for example, not only calculated artillery firing tables for the US Army, it worked in secret to study the feasibility of thermonuclear weapons.

            This was a huge breakthrough. Programmable computers guided astronauts from Earth to the moon and were reprogrammed during Apollo 13’s troubled mission to bring its astronauts safely back to Earth.

            You’ve grown up during the Era of Programming. It even drives the phone you hold in your hand. But the dark data problem has also grown. Modern businesses and technology generate so much data that even the finest programmable supercomputer can't analyze it before the “heat-death” of the universe. Electronic computing is facing a crisis.

        <h3 style="color: #2a4d69;">The Era of AI</h3>
        <p>
            The history of artificial intelligence dates back to philosophers thinking about the question, "What more can be done with the world we live in?" This question led to discussions and the very beginning of many ideas about the possibilities involving technology. 
        </p>

        <h3 style="color: #3c6e71;">1940s</h3>
        <p>
            Alan Turing publishes <em>Computing Machinery and Intelligence</em>. In the paper, Turing proposes to answer the question "can machines think?" and introduces the <strong>Turing Test</strong>.
        </p>

        <h3 style="color: #3c6e71;">1956</h3>
        <p>
            John McCarthy coins the term "artificial intelligence" at Dartmouth College. Later that year, the Logic Theorist AI program is created.
        </p>

        <h3 style="color: #3c6e71;">1970–80</h3>
        <p>1st AI Winter caused by high expectations from end users and reduced funding.</p>

        <h3 style="color: #3c6e71;">1982–93</h3>
        <p>2nd AI Winter caused by unmet expectations and limited computing power.</p>

        <h3 style="color: #3c6e71;">1997</h3>
        <p>IBM Deep Blue beats world chess champion Garry Kasparov.</p>

        <h3 style="color: #3c6e71;">2011</h3>

        <h3 style="color: #2a4d69;">The Era of AI began one summer in 1956</h3>
        <p>
            A group of researchers gathered at Dartmouth and launched a scientific revolution, coining the term “artificial intelligence.” They believed intelligence could be described so precisely that a machine could simulate it.
        </p>

        <h3 style="color: #2a4d69;">But then came winter</h3>
        <p>
            Limitations in processing power and storage brought progress to a standstill.
        </p>

        <h3 style="color: #3c6e71;">Limited calculating power</h3>
        <p>
            Machines couldn’t process enough instructions to match even basic human abilities.
        </p>

        <h3 style="color: #3c6e71;">Limited information storage</h3>
        <p>
            No system could store the amount of common knowledge known by a toddler.
        </p>

        <h3 style="color: #2a4d69;">The weather was rough for half a century</h3>
        <p>
            Expert systems brought hope in the 1980s, but that too eventually faded.
        </p>

        <h3 style="color: #2a4d69;">Then came another AI chill</h3>
        <p>
            The rise of personal computers caused a shift in funding away from large-scale AI systems.
        </p>

        <h3 style="color: #2a4d69;">Now, the forecast is sunny</h3>
        <p>
            Since the mid-1990s, AI has gained traction again. Computers became powerful enough, and AI began winning at chess, driving cars, diagnosing diseases, and more. The Two Winters of AI have ended!

<h1 style="color: #2c3e50;">Structured, Semi-Structured, or Unstructured Data</h1>

  <h3 style="color: #34495e;">Data</h3>
  <p>Data is raw information. Data might be facts, statistics, opinions, or any kind of content that is recorded in some format. This could include voices, photos, names, and even dance moves! Data can be organized into the following three types.</p>

  <h3 style="color: #1abc9c;">Structured Data</h3>
  <p style="border: 2px solid #1abc9c; background-color: #e8f8f5; padding: 10px;">
    Structured data is typically categorized as quantitative data and is highly organized. Structured data is information that can be organized in rows and columns. Perhaps you've seen structured data in a spreadsheet, like Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel. Examples of structured data include names, dates, addresses, credit card numbers, and stock information.
  </p>

  <h3 style="color: #e74c3c;">Unstructured Data</h3>
  <p style="border: 2px solid #e74c3c; background-color: #fdecea; padding: 10px;">
    Unstructured data, also known as dark data, is typically categorized as qualitative data. It cannot be processed and analyzed by conventional data tools and methods. Unstructured data lacks any built-in organization, or structure. Examples of unstructured data include images, texts, customer comments, medical records, and even song lyrics.
  </p>

  <h3 style="color: #f39c12;">Semi-Structured Data</h3>
  <p style="border: 2px solid #f39c12; background-color: #fef5e7; padding: 10px;">
    Semi-structured data is the “bridge” between structured and unstructured data. It doesn't have a predefined data model. It combines features of both structured data and unstructured data. It's more complex than structured data, yet easier to store than unstructured data. Semi-structured data uses metadata to identify specific data characteristics and scale data into records and preset fields. Metadata ultimately enables semi-structured data to be better cataloged, searched, and analyzed than unstructured data.

    An example of semi-structured data is a video on a social media site. The video by itself is unstructured data, but a video typically has text for the internet to easily categorize that information, such as through a hashtag to identify a location.

    The importance of unstructured data is rapidly increasing. Recent projections indicate that 95% of businesses prioritize unstructured data management. Are you wondering why this is important? Why would anyone want to search through a mountain of data such as social media posts?

    Here are just some of the many people and organizations that might need to do this:
    <ul>
      <li>A sneaker designer looking for new trends</li>
      <li>Governments searching for possible terrorists</li>
      <li>Pandemic experts trying to anticipate disease outbreaks</li>
      <li>Financial institutions preparing for good times or a recession</li>
    </ul>

    Experts estimate that about 80% of all the data in today’s world is unstructured. It contains so many variables and changes so quickly that no conventional computer program can learn much from it.
  </p>

  <h3 style="color: #9b59b6;">Analyzing Unstructured Data</h3>
  <p style="border: 2px solid #9b59b6; background-color: #f5eef8; padding: 10px;">
    Imagine a programmable computer trying to extract meaning from billions of data like this! What kind of program would someone write that could sort out every eventuality among the clutter? How would someone build a long enough list of keywords to find anything useful?

    Unstructured data hides answers to disease prevention, criminal activity, stock markets—almost every aspect of civilization today. Without those answers, people and organizations cannot make useful predictions or recommendations.

    But AI can shed light on unstructured data! AI uses new kinds of computing—some modeled on the human brain—to rapidly give dark data structure, and from it, make new discoveries. AI can even learn things—by itself—from the data it manages and teach itself how to make better predictions over time.

    This is the Era of AI, and it changes everything!
  </p>
 <h1 style="border: 2px solid #333; padding: 10px; background-color: #e0e0e0;">Is Machine Learning the Answer to the Unstructured Data Problem</h1>

  <h3 style="border-left: 4px solid #4CAF50; padding-left: 10px;">Two ways to solve dark data problems</h3>
  <p style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px; background-color: #fff;">
    If AI doesn’t rely on programming instructions to work with unstructured data, how does AI do it? Machine learning can analyze dark data far more quickly than a programmable computer can. To see why, consider the problem of finding a route through big city traffic using a navigation system. It’s a dark data problem because solving it requires working with not only a complicated street map, but also with changing variables like weather, traffic jams, and accidents. Let’s look at how two different systems might try to solve this problem.
  </p>

  <h3 style="border-left: 4px solid #2196F3; padding-left: 10px;">Programmable Computer</h3>
  <p style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px; background-color: #fff;">
    Researchers might upload onto the computer a complete database of all possible routes through the city. This is an enormous collection of structured data.<br><br>
    Then they would have to add much more data describing current weather and traffic conditions. This would have to be revised every few minutes for the entire city!<br><br>
    Then they might use a programmable computer to search through the data until it finds a route from start to finish. The entire project would require astronomical resources and time, if it could be accomplished at all!
  </p>

  <h3 style="border-left: 4px solid #FF9800; padding-left: 10px;">AI with Machine Learning</h3>
  <p style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px; background-color: #fff;">
    The machine learning AI would treat the problem like climbing a tree. The system would try a route, as if starting at the base of the trunk. Upon reaching a branch, the system would then fork in one direction and continue doing so until it reached either a dead end or the desired destination.<br><br>
    It would do this over and over again, then compare successful routes to identify the shortest one. Although the work sounds repetitious, it requires fewer resources and can be completed more quickly.
  </p>

  <h3 style="border-left: 4px solid #9C27B0; padding-left: 10px;">The Machine Learning Process is Entirely Different</h3>
  <p style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px; background-color: #fff;">
    <strong>The machine learning process has advantages:</strong><br><br>
    • It doesn’t need a database of all the possible routes from one place to another. It just needs to know where places are on the map.<br>
    • It can respond to traffic problems quickly because it doesn’t need to store alternative routes for every possible traffic situation. It notes where slowdowns are and finds a way around them through trial and error.<br>
    • It can work very quickly. While trying single turns one at a time, it can work through millions of tiny calculations.<br><br>
    But machine learning has two more advantages that programmable computers lack.
  </p>

  <h3 style="border-left: 4px solid #00BCD4; padding-left: 10px;">Machine Learning Can Predict</h3>
  <p style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px; background-color: #fff;">
    You know this already. A machine can determine, “Based on traffic right now, this route is likely to be faster than that one.” It knows this because it compared routes as it built them.
  </p>

  <h3 style="border-left: 4px solid #8BC34A; padding-left: 10px;">Machine Learning Learns</h3>
  <p style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px; background-color: #fff;">
    It can notice that your car was delayed by a temporary detour and adjust its recommendations to help other drivers.
  </p>

  <h1 style="border: 2px solid #333; padding: 10px; background-color: #e0e0e0;">Machine Learning Uses Probabilistic Calculation</h1>

  <h3 style="border-left: 4px solid #3F51B5; padding-left: 10px;">Machine Learning Uses Probabilistic Calculation</h3>
  <p style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px; background-color: #fff;">
    There are two other ways to contrast classical and machine learning systems. One is deterministic and the other is probabilistic.<br><br>
    For a deterministic system, there must be an enormous, predetermined structure of routes—a gigantic database of possibilities from which the machine can make its choice. If a certain route leads to the destination, then the machine flags it as “YES”. If not, it flags it as “NO”. This is basically binary thinking: on or off, yes or no. This is the essence of a computer program. The answer is either true or false, not a confidence value.<br><br>
    Machine learning is probabilistic. It never says “YES” or “NO”. Machine learning is analog (like waves gradually going up and down) rather than binary (like arrows pointing upward and downward). Machine learning constructs every possible route to a destination and compares them in real time, including all the variables such as changing traffic. So, a machine learning system doesn’t say, “This is the fastest route.” It says something like, “I am 84% confident that this route will get you there in the shortest time.”
  </p>

  <h3 style="border-left: 4px solid #F44336; padding-left: 10px;">If Machine Learning Offers Only Probabilities, Who Makes the Final Decision?</h3>
  <p style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px; background-color: #fff;">
    This can literally be a life-and-death question. Suppose you have a serious disease and your doctor offers you a choice. Do you want your doctor to prescribe your treatment, or do you want the treatment that a machine learning system determines is most likely to succeed?
  </p>

  <h3 style="border-left: 4px solid #795548; padding-left: 10px;">Evaluate Your Thinking</h3>
  <p style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px; background-color: #fff;">
    As you learned, the GPS offers different routes to choose from. Machine learning leaves room for humans to make the final decision. You, or an expert, can choose which route to take based on possible outcomes and personal experience.<br><br>
    Consider how a machine learning system might work with the medical question you considered previously. As a doctor considers how to treat a cancer patient, the AI ingests your entire medical record plus every research paper about this cancer published in the last few years. This takes a few seconds. But the AI doesn’t say, “Do this” or “Do that”. That would be a deterministic solution that cuts the doctor and patient out of the decision.<br><br>
    Instead, the AI provides a probabilistic statement such as, “There’s a 92% chance that this treatment will work, and an 87% chance that this other treatment will work. Here is what would be involved in conducting each treatment option.” Now the doctor can consult with you and together you make the choice. In other words, AI, the doctor, and you have formed a partnership in which machines predict but humans judge!
  </p>

  <h3 style="border-left: 4px solid #607D8B; padding-left: 10px;">Machine Learning Enables a Rich Partnership Between Technology and Humans</h3>
  <p style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px; background-color: #fff;">
    AI systems and humans excel at different things. For example, you, as a person, might excel at imagining possibilities, while AI excels at pinpointing patterns.
  </p>

  <h3 style="border-left: 4px solid #9E9E9E; padding-left: 10px;">Does Common Sense Make Sense?</h3>
  <p style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px; background-color: #fff;">
    It turns out that in fields, ranging from medicine and education to social studies and government, the best decisions are made using a balance of human and machine strengths. But remember, there is another elusive but vital capability that must also be considered: common sense. You might know people with strong common sense and understand its value. You also might have seen or read output from machines that makes no sense. Yet, there’s a contribution to be made from both sides.<br><br>
    Common sense draws on many complex generalizations mixed with compassion and abstractions. At this time, only humans can use common sense well. The problem is that common sense is often tainted with bias that can distort your judgment. AI systems can balance this. As long as AI systems are provided and trained with unbiased data, they can make recommendations that are free of bias. A partnership between humans and machines can lead to sensible decisions.
  </p>
  <h1 style="text-align:center; color: #2c3e50;">Three Common Methods of Machine Learning</h1>

  <div style="border: 2px solid #2980b9; border-radius: 8px; background-color: #ecf0f1; padding: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
    <h3 style="color: #2980b9;">Supervised Learning</h3>
    <p>
      Supervised learning is about providing AI with enough examples to make accurate predictions.
      All supervised learning algorithms need <strong>labeled data</strong>. Labeled data is data that is grouped into samples that are tagged with one or more labels.
      In other words, applying supervised learning requires you to tell your model:
      <ul>
        <li>What the key characteristics of a thing are (also called features)</li>
        <li>What the thing actually is</li>
      </ul>
      For example, the information might be drawings and photos of animals, some of which are dogs and are labeled “dog”.
      The machine will learn by identifying a pattern for “dog”. When the machine sees a new dog photo and is asked, “What is this?”, it will respond, “dog”, with high accuracy.
      This is known as a <strong>classification problem</strong>.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div style="border: 2px solid #27ae60; border-radius: 8px; background-color: #e9f7ef; padding: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
    <h3 style="color: #27ae60;">Unsupervised Learning</h3>
    <p>
      In unsupervised learning, a person feeds a machine a large amount of information, asks a question, and then the machine is left to figure out how to answer the question by itself.
      For example, the machine might be fed many photos and articles about dogs. It will classify and cluster information about all of them.
      When shown a new photo of a dog, the machine can identify the photo as a dog, with reasonable accuracy.
      <br><br>
      Unsupervised learning occurs when the algorithm is not given a specific “wrong” or “right” outcome. Instead, the algorithm is given <strong>unlabeled data</strong>.
      It is helpful when you don't know how to classify data, such as customer segmentation in banking.
      <br><br>
      This type of learning discovers similarities and differences in information, ideal for:
      <ul>
        <li>Exploratory data analysis</li>
        <li>Cross-selling strategies</li>
        <li>Customer segmentation</li>
        <li>Image recognition</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  </div>

  <div style="border: 2px solid #d35400; border-radius: 8px; background-color: #fdf2e9; padding: 20px; margin-bottom: 40px;">
    <h3 style="color: #d35400;">Reinforcement Learning</h3>
    <p>
      Reinforcement learning is similar to supervised learning, but the algorithm isn’t trained using sample data.
      This model learns through <strong>trial and error</strong>.
      A sequence of successful outcomes is reinforced to develop the best recommendation for a given problem.
      <br><br>
      The foundation is rewarding the “right” behavior and punishing the “wrong” behavior.
      Positive behavior earns a <strong>reward</strong>, while incorrect predictions receive a <strong>penalty</strong>.
      Over time, the machine’s predictions improve automatically based on this feedback.

    <h3 style="color: #8e44ad;">Three Levels of Artificial Intelligence</h3>
    <p>
      Perhaps 25 years from now, General AI is expected to emerge.
      AI researcher Nick Bostrom defines this superintelligence as, 
      “an intellect that is much smarter than the best human brains in practically every field, including scientific creativity, general wisdom and social skills.”
      <br><br>
      General AI will enable supersmart bots and technologies to link AI with the Internet of Things through “<strong>embodied cognition</strong>”.
      This will allow machines to interact in human-like ways and work alongside humans.

    <h1 style="color: #2c3e50; text-align: center;">The Debater Project</h1>
    <h3 style="color: #2980b9;">Can an AI win an argument?</h3>
    <p style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px; background-color: #fdfdfd;">
      If you ask an artificial intelligence system a question on a topic for which it’s been trained, it can look up an answer. The quiz show, Jeopardy!, proved that years ago. But can an AI system carry on a continuing conversation and respond to what is said with each exchange? Let’s make this question even more difficult: Can an AI win a debate with a human expert about a complicated topic?
      To answer this question, consider a famous experiment, then learn how AI works with spoken and written language. IBM began developing Project Debater in 2012, hoping to build a machine that could do more than win debates with humans. In other words, IBM Project Debater would need to be able to do more than just answer questions in a human language; it would need to have the ability to listen to a series of competitive arguments posed by humans and respond to them intelligently. IBM's ultimate goal was to build a system that could help people make evidence-based, bias-free decisions on difficult topics where the answers aren’t obvious.
    </p>

    <h3 style="color: #2980b9;">Debate steps</h3>
    <h3 style="color: #2980b9;">It takes four steps to win a debate</h3>
    <p style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px; background-color: #fdfdfd;">
      To get a feel for what winning a debate requires, try putting yourself in the AI’s position. What would it take to enable you to intelligently debate a human opponent? Learn and understand the topic, Build a position, Organize your proof, Respond to your opponent.
    </p>

    <h3 style="color: #27ae60;">Learn and understand the topic</h3>
    <p style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px; background-color: #fdfdfd;">
      Ingest several billion passages from newspapers, books, and journals. (AI researchers call this collection of learned material a corpus.) Then, structure all that content so you can relate concepts to each other and evaluate them, even when they’re stated in different ways.
    </p>

    <h3 style="color: #27ae60;">Build a position</h3>
    <p style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px; background-color: #fdfdfd;">
      Create an opening speech made of short pieces of text pasted together from the corpus. Your speech should detail your position on the debate topic. It can’t be a jumble of phrases. It must present a compelling argument, in logical order, using good grammar.
    </p>

    <h3 style="color: #27ae60;">Organize your proof</h3>
    <p style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px; background-color: #fdfdfd;">
      Learn the deeper meaning of the facts that surround your topic. Decide what evidence is strongest and arrange your proof by themes. Adjust your arrangement each time new evidence arrives. This will help you find updated or completely new information that can score points against your opponent’s position.
    </p>

    <h3 style="color: #27ae60;">Respond to your opponent</h3>
    <p style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px; background-color: #fdfdfd;">
      Listen to your opponent’s arguments and rebuttals, then deliver a convincing rebuttal that refutes your opponent and further proves your case.
    </p>

    <h3 style="color: #8e44ad;">Understanding</h3>
    <p style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px; background-color: #fdfdfd;">
      Cognitive systems understand like humans do.
    </p>

    <h3 style="color: #8e44ad;">Reasoning</h3>
    <p style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px; background-color: #fdfdfd;">
      They reason underlying ideas and concepts; they debate, they infer and extract concepts.
    </p>

    <h3 style="color: #8e44ad;">Learning</h3>
    <p style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px; background-color: #fdfdfd;">
      Never stop learning—advancing with each new piece of information, interaction, and outcome. They develop expertise.
    </p>

    <h3 style="color: #8e44ad;">Interacting</h3>
    <p style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px; background-color: #fdfdfd;">

    <h3 style="color: #e67e22;">Steps in Natural Language Processing</h3>
    <h3 style="color: #e67e22;">Is it difficult to understand human language?</h3>
    <p style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px; background-color: #fdfdfd;">
      Understanding human language is difficult, even for people who have grown up with it. Human language is incredibly complex, full of strange expressions that seem to contradict each other, metaphors that require cultural knowledge to understand, and grammatical structures that sometimes turn simple ideas into tongue-twisters.
      Machines require systems that research scientists call natural language processing, or NLP, to understand human language.
      IBM Project Debater was the most complex AI system IBM Research had ever built to understand human language. Whether or not you agree with IBM Project Debater's position in this debate, IBM Project Debater rebutted its opponent with clear and well-argued statements, complete with examples and even a metaphor.
      This is a major step forward in the field of natural language processing. IBM Project Debater was a success. Gradually, this artificial intelligence grew more skilled until it could regularly win debates. Once again, this was a major step forward in the field of natural language processing.

 <h1 style="color: #2c3e50; border-bottom: 3px solid #3498db; padding-bottom: 10px;">AI performs natural language processing</h1>

  <div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 15px; background-color: #fff; margin-bottom: 20px;">
    <h3 style="color: #2980b9;">NLP sentence segmentation and tokens</h3>
    <h3 style="color: #2980b9;">Natural language processing</h3>
    <p>Computers are best at working with structured data, in which everything is neatly grouped and labeled. Unfortunately for machines, human language is anything but structured. You’ve been using language for most of your life. Your brain accomplishes this through some of the most complicated neural circuitry on Earth. But it is very difficult to create machines that can work with human language. Getting machines to understand our human language is one of the hardest tasks in artificial intelligence today.</p>
    <p>Languages are nuanced and complicated and present difficulties for computers that are used to fixed rules. Language can also be easily misinterpreted. Take the famous Groucho Marx quote: <i>"One morning, I shot an elephant in my pajamas. How he got my pajamas, I don't know."</i></p>
    <p>To actually understand what is being said is really hard for the computer to do. What we try to solve through the field of natural language processing is to start cracking what does he mean when we use these words in sentences. How are sentences related to one another? Is this word close to this other word and why? So, that is a field that for us is so easy; it's very hard for computers to do.</p>
  </div>

  <div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 15px; background-color: #fff; margin-bottom: 20px;">
    <h3 style="color: #2980b9;">In NLP, machines segment sentences and extract meaning from “tokens” of human language</h3>
    <p>Human language is unstructured. Although it is loosely held together by rules of grammar, our language expresses information in many confusing ways. Unlike structured information, which can be arranged in tables or matrices with neatly labeled rows and columns, unstructured information is messy and difficult to understand. To deal with the “messiness” of unstructured information, computers begin with one sentence at a time. This is called sentence segmentation.</p>
    <p>Computers then break the information into small chunks of information, called tokens, that can be individually classified. Once the tokens in text have been sorted into a structure based on what they mean, NLP can work with them.</p>
    <p>The following activities show you how Groucho Marx’s joke can be tokenized into useful categories called entities and relationships. You’ll learn the meanings of these words as you continue.</p>
  </div>

  <div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 15px; background-color: #fff; margin-bottom: 20px;">
    <h3 style="color: #2980b9;">Entity</h3>
    <p>An entity is a noun representing a person, place, or thing. It’s not an adjective, verb, or other article of speech.</p>

    <h3 style="color: #2980b9;">Relationships</h3>
    <p>A relationship is a group of two or more entities that have a strong connection to one another. Once an AI has classified entities and relationships in text or speech, the AI can begin structuring the information as a step toward understanding it. Your brain, by the way, does the same thing, which might have helped you find entities and relationships in the previous activities.</p>
    <p>For example, consider the following two sentences: “Armen broke the glass. He always breaks the glass.” Notice that there is a relationship between the two sentences: the word <strong>he</strong> is related to the word <strong>Armen</strong>. The machine uses NLP to identify this relationship.</p>
  </div>

  <div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 15px; background-color: #fff; margin-bottom: 20px;">
    <h3 style="color: #2980b9;">Concepts</h3>
    <p>A concept is something implied in a sentence but not actually stated. This is trickier because it involves matching ideas rather than the specific words present in the sentence.</p>
  </div>

  <h1 style="color: #2c3e50; border-bottom: 3px solid #e74c3c; padding-bottom: 10px;">Emotion detection and sentiment analysis</h1>

  <div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 15px; background-color: #fff; margin-bottom: 20px;">
    <h3 style="color: #c0392b;">Emotion detection and sentiment analysis are not the same thing</h3>
    <p>Although emotions and sentiment deal with feelings rather than facts or actions, distinguishing between them can help an AI better understand a sentence.</p>
  </div>

  <div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 15px; background-color: #fff; margin-bottom: 20px;">
    <h3 style="color: #c0392b;">Emotion detection</h3>
    <p>Emotion detection identifies distinct human emotion types.</p>
    <p>For example, you can determine if the emotion being expressed is anger, happiness, or fear after reading a user's rating and comments in an online customer satisfaction survey.</p>
    <p>AI can be trained to classify emotions. Identifying the right emotional token can make a big difference when an AI system is reading a social media post or a customer service chat, in which different emotions significantly change the meaning of a sentence.</p>
  </div>

  <div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 15px; background-color: #fff;">
    <h3 style="color: #c0392b;">Sentiment analysis</h3>
    <p>Sentiment analysis isn’t a specific emotion — at least, not as computer scientists use the term. Instead, it’s a measure of the strength of an emotion.</p>
    <p>You can think of sentiment as a sliding scale between positive and negative, with neutral in the middle.</p>
