    Did you know that farmers can put sensors on their crops that tell them when to water, how much water is needed, and when to harvest? With this information, farmers can get the best quality and quantity from their crops. Coal miners can place sensors in a mine that detect tiny amounts of dangerous gases. This information saves lives. Automobile insurance companies can offer drivers lower rates in exchange for access to their driving data. This allows for fairer and more accurate pricing and increases profits while lowering costs.

    Future where everything is connected. And that future is not very far away! There are already refrigerators that can tell your connected device that the supply of milk is getting low. And smart homes where you can tell your home system to make coffee. We even have some driverless cars!
  </p>

  <p style="color:black;   padding:10px;">
    Connections are how we create networks. But what do we really mean by ‘networks’? If you use social media, you know your social network there. The power grid in your city or town is also a network. A grove of Aspen trees is actually a network of many trees that all share the same root system. There are networks in nature and human-created networks. The internet is a network of networks, and some of those networks are made up of many things. Those networks are what we call the IoT.

  <h1>The Impact of Digital Transformation on Business</h1>

  <div style="  padding:14px; margin-bottom:16px;    ">
    <p style="color:#000000; margin:0 0 8px 0;">Digital Technology has enabled business to innovate their approach to interacting with society. People from all generations are more comfortable with digital technology and are using smart devices to their advantage throughout their busy days.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Smart Buildings</h2>

  <div style="  padding:14px; margin-bottom:16px;    ">
    <p style="color:#000000; margin:0 0 8px 0;">Many companies now provide some or all of their services on-line. From the comfort of your home, car, gym, or office, you can shop for groceries on-line, order restaurant meals to be delivered to your door, book travel on-line, order clothes, camping gear, taxis, stay connected to friends, or meet a new love interest.</p>

    <p style="color:#000000; margin:0 0 8px 0;">Sensors are everywhere generating massive amounts of data.</p>

    <p style="color:#000000; margin:0 0 8px 0;">Smart homes can be equipped with motion sensors, water sensors, light sensors, doorbell sensors, and temperature sensors. There can be sensors in traffic lights, transport trucks, parking garages, security cameras, trains, and planes. All of these sensors and measuring devices collect and transmit their data. The data can be stored and analyzed at a later date or it can be analyzed immediately to be used to modify computers, mobile devices, or processes of any sort.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>How is the stored and analyzed data used?</h2>

  <div style="  padding:14px; margin-bottom:16px;    ">
    <h3 style="margin-top:0;">Businesses</h3>
    <p style="color:#000000; margin:0 0 8px 0;">Businesses determine buying patterns, forecast new trends, and streamline production.</p>

    <h3>Governments</h3>
    <p style="color:#000000; margin:0 0 8px 0;">Governments monitor the environment, forecast population trends, predict crime rates, and plan for social services.</p>

    <h3>Cities</h3>
    <p style="color:#000000; margin:0 0 8px 0;">Cities control traffic, monitor parking, provide police or fire support quicker, and control waste management.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Can Smart Devices Think?</h2>

  <div style="  padding:14px; margin-bottom:16px;    ">
    <p style="color:#000000; margin:0 0 8px 0;">All digital devices work based on computer programs and supplied data. Artificial Intelligence implies that these devices are able to think on their own. If programmed appropriately, smart devices are able to evaluate data that is provided to them and modify processes or settings “on the fly”. If they are provided with sufficient data, they can “learn” and modify their own code based on the new parameters.</p>

    <p style="color:#000000; margin:0 0 8px 0;">Imagine a refrigerated transport truck, carrying frozen goods, that is equipped with a global positioning sensor. As the truck drives into a major city, the sensor determines that there is an accident ahead that is causing major traffic congestion. The sensor sends the data to the computer system that collects the data and make decisions. The system then alerts the driver to the new conditions so that the accident can be bypassed. This automatic interaction has saved the driver time and will get the transported product to market faster with a product that is still frozen.</p>

    <p style="color:#000000; margin:0 0 8px 0;">Corporate offices can be occupied by thousands of employees. Keeping the environment, such as lighting, heat, humidity, in the building within acceptable parameters helps to keep employees happy and therefore more productive.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Smart Cities</h2>

  <div style="  padding:14px; margin-bottom:16px;    ">
    <p style="color:#000000; margin:0 0 8px 0;">Smart Cities, such as Barcelona, Spain, use sensors to control many of their infrastructure systems such as traffic flow, parking, water utilization, and hydro.</p>

    <p style="color:#000000; margin:0 0 8px 0;"><strong>Example 1:</strong> Weight sensors in parking spaces allow drivers to quickly know where there is an available parking spot. This reduces driving and idling time for the driver and lowers carbon emissions for the environment.</p>

    <p style="color:#000000; margin:0 0 8px 0;"><strong>Example 2:</strong> Sensors on traffic lights can detect traffic congestion. This data is sent to the computer system that collects data and make decisions. The new decisions are sent to actuators that modify red versus green light times to assist the flow of traffic. This also alleviates idling but also reduces driver frustration and accidents.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Self-driving Cars</h2>

  <div style="  padding:14px; margin-bottom:16px;   ">
    <p style="color:#000000; margin:0 0 8px 0;">Self-driving cars are revolutionizing transportation. The cars are equipped with many ultrasound sensors, cameras, precision GPSs, and computers. The combination of the on-board equipment allows the computers to identify, other cars, lanes, pedestrians, and obstructions. This information allows the car to stay in its lane, stop when required, and weave around obstructions.</p>

    <p style="color:#000000; margin:0 0 8px 0;">Some of the manufacturers in the "autonomous car" market are Tesla Motors, General Motors, Volvo, and Mercedes-Benz. Corporations such as Waymo, Google's sibling, and Uber are also designing and testing the technology.</p>

    <p style="color:#000000; margin:0 0 8px 0;">The road to complete autonomy using this technology is complicated. There have been many high profile crashes and some serious accidents involving self-driving cars. Some states within the USA have already approved limited use of self-driving cars but researchers believe it will be a few years before the technology becomes mainstream.</p>

    <p style="color:#000000; margin:0 0 8px 0;">Once the technology is proven, what is next? Self-driving trucks? Airplanes? Trains?</p>
